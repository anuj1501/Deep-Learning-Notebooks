The Episode of the Old Bailey\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE MEXICAN SEER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy name is Seymour Wilbraham Wentworth. I am brother-in-law and\\r\\nsecretary to Sir Charles Vandrift, the South African millionaire and\\r\\nfamous financier. Many years ago, when Charlie Vandrift was a small\\r\\nlawyer in Cape Town, I had the (qualified) good fortune to marry his\\r\\nsister. Much later, when the Vandrift estate and farm near Kimberley\\r\\ndeveloped by degrees into the Cloetedorp Golcondas, Limited, my\\r\\nbrother-in-law offered me the not unremunerative post of secretary;\\r\\nin which capacity I have ever since been his constant and attached\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is not a man whom any common sharper can take in, is Charles\\r\\nVandrift. Middle height, square build, firm mouth, keen eyes--the\\r\\nvery picture of a sharp and successful business genius. I have only\\r\\nknown one rogue impose upon Sir Charles, and that one rogue, as the\\r\\nCommissary of Police at Nice remarked, would doubtless have imposed\\r\\nupon a syndicate of Vidocq, Robert Houdin, and Cagliostro.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had run across to the Riviera for a few weeks in the season. Our\\r\\nobject being strictly rest and recreation from the arduous duties\\r\\nof financial combination, we did not think it necessary to take our\\r\\nwives out with us. Indeed, Lady Vandrift is absolutely wedded to the\\r\\njoys of London, and does not appreciate the rural delights of the\\r\\nMediterranean littoral. But Sir Charles and I, though immersed in\\r\\naffairs when at home, both thoroughly enjoy the complete change from\\r\\nthe City to the charming vegetation and pellucid air on the terrace\\r\\nat Monte Carlo. We _are_ so fond of scenery. That delicious view\\r\\nover the rocks of Monaco, with the Maritime Alps in the rear, and\\r\\nthe blue sea in front, not to mention the imposing Casino in the\\r\\nforeground, appeals to me as one of the most beautiful prospects in\\r\\nall Europe. Sir Charles has a sentimental attachment for the place.\\r\\nHe finds it restores and freshens him, after the turmoil of London,\\r\\nto win a few hundreds at roulette in the course of an afternoon\\r\\namong the palms and cactuses and pure breezes of Monte Carlo. The\\r\\ncountry, say I, for a jaded intellect! However, we never on any\\r\\naccount actually stop in the Principality itself. Sir Charles thinks\\r\\nMonte Carlo is not a sound address for a financier\\'s letters. He\\r\\nprefers a comfortable hotel on the Promenade des Anglais at Nice,\\r\\nwhere he recovers health and renovates his nervous system by taking\\r\\ndaily excursions along the coast to the Casino.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis particular season we were snugly ensconced at the H\\xc3\\xb4tel des\\r\\nAnglais. We had capital quarters on the first floor--salon, study,\\r\\nand bedrooms--and found on the spot a most agreeable cosmopolitan\\r\\nsociety. All Nice, just then, was ringing with talk about a curious\\r\\nimpostor, known to his followers as the Great Mexican Seer, and\\r\\nsupposed to be gifted with second sight, as well as with endless\\r\\nother supernatural powers. Now, it is a peculiarity of my able\\r\\nbrother-in-law\\'s that, when he meets with a quack, he burns to\\r\\nexpose him; he is so keen a man of business himself that it gives\\r\\nhim, so to speak, a disinterested pleasure to unmask and detect\\r\\nimposture in others. Many ladies at the hotel, some of whom had met\\r\\nand conversed with the Mexican Seer, were constantly telling us\\r\\nstrange stories of his doings. He had disclosed to one the present\\r\\nwhereabouts of a runaway husband; he had pointed out to another the\\r\\nnumbers that would win at roulette next evening; he had shown a\\r\\nthird the image on a screen of the man she had for years adored\\r\\nwithout his knowledge. Of course, Sir Charles didn\\'t believe a word\\r\\nof it; but his curiosity was roused; he wished to see and judge for\\r\\nhimself of the wonderful thought-reader.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What would be his terms, do you think, for a private s\\xc3\\xa9ance?\" he\\r\\nasked of Madame Picardet, the lady to whom the Seer had successfully\\r\\npredicted the winning numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He does not work for money,\" Madame Picardet answered, \"but for\\r\\nthe good of humanity. I\\'m sure he would gladly come and exhibit for\\r\\nnothing his miraculous faculties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nonsense!\" Sir Charles answered. \"The man must live. I\\'d pay him\\r\\nfive guineas, though, to see him alone. What hotel is he stopping at?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Cosmopolitan, I think,\" the lady answered. \"Oh no; I remember\\r\\nnow, the Westminster.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles turned to me quietly. \"Look here, Seymour,\" he\\r\\nwhispered. \"Go round to this fellow\\'s place immediately after\\r\\ndinner, and offer him five pounds to give a private s\\xc3\\xa9ance at once\\r\\nin my rooms, without mentioning who I am to him; keep the name quite\\r\\nquiet. Bring him back with you, too, and come straight upstairs\\r\\nwith him, so that there may be no collusion. We\\'ll see just how much\\r\\nthe fellow can tell us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI went as directed. I found the Seer a very remarkable and\\r\\ninteresting person. He stood about Sir Charles\\'s own height, but was\\r\\nslimmer and straighter, with an aquiline nose, strangely piercing\\r\\neyes, very large black pupils, and a finely-chiselled close-shaven\\r\\nface, like the bust of Antinous in our hall in Mayfair. What gave him\\r\\nhis most characteristic touch, however, was his odd head of hair,\\r\\ncurly and wavy like Paderewski\\'s, standing out in a halo round his\\r\\nhigh white forehead and his delicate profile. I could see at a\\r\\nglance why he succeeded so well in impressing women; he had the\\r\\nlook of a poet, a singer, a prophet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have come round,\" I said, \"to ask whether you will consent to\\r\\ngive a s\\xc3\\xa9ance at once in a friend\\'s rooms; and my principal wishes\\r\\nme to add that he is prepared to pay five pounds as the price of the\\r\\nentertainment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSe\\xc3\\xb1or Antonio Herrera--that was what he called himself--bowed to\\r\\nme with impressive Spanish politeness. His dusky olive cheeks were\\r\\nwrinkled with a smile of gentle contempt as he answered gravely--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do not sell my gifts; I bestow them freely. If your friend--your\\r\\nanonymous friend--desires to behold the cosmic wonders that are\\r\\nwrought through my hands, I am glad to show them to him.\\r\\nFortunately, as often happens when it is necessary to convince\\r\\nand confound a sceptic (for that your friend is a sceptic I feel\\r\\ninstinctively), I chance to have no engagements at all this\\r\\nevening.\" He ran his hand through his fine, long hair reflectively.\\r\\n\"Yes, I go,\" he continued, as if addressing some unknown presence\\r\\nthat hovered about the ceiling; \"I go; come with me!\" Then he put on\\r\\nhis broad sombrero, with its crimson ribbon, wrapped a cloak round\\r\\nhis shoulders, lighted a cigarette, and strode forth by my side\\r\\ntowards the H\\xc3\\xb4tel des Anglais.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe talked little by the way, and that little in curt sentences. He\\r\\nseemed buried in deep thought; indeed, when we reached the door and\\r\\nI turned in, he walked a step or two farther on, as if not noticing\\r\\nto what place I had brought him. Then he drew himself up short, and\\r\\ngazed around him for a moment. \"Ha, the Anglais,\" he said--and I may\\r\\nmention in passing that his English, in spite of a slight southern\\r\\naccent, was idiomatic and excellent. \"It is here, then; it is here!\"\\r\\nHe was addressing once more the unseen presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI smiled to think that these childish devices were intended to\\r\\ndeceive Sir Charles Vandrift. Not quite the sort of man (as the City\\r\\nof London knows) to be taken in by hocus-pocus. And all this, I saw,\\r\\nwas the cheapest and most commonplace conjurer\\'s patter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went upstairs to our rooms. Charles had gathered together a\\r\\nfew friends to watch the performance. The Seer entered, wrapt in\\r\\nthought. He was in evening dress, but a red sash round his waist\\r\\ngave a touch of picturesqueness and a dash of colour. He paused for\\r\\na moment in the middle of the salon, without letting his eyes rest\\r\\non anybody or anything. Then he walked straight up to Charles, and\\r\\nheld out his dark hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-evening,\" he said. \"You are the host. My soul\\'s sight tells\\r\\nme so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good shot,\" Sir Charles answered. \"These fellows have to be\\r\\nquick-witted, you know, Mrs. Mackenzie, or they\\'d never get on\\r\\nat it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seer gazed about him, and smiled blankly at a person or two\\r\\nwhose faces he seemed to recognise from a previous existence. Then\\r\\nCharles began to ask him a few simple questions, not about himself,\\r\\nbut about me, just to test him. He answered most of them with\\r\\nsurprising correctness. \"His name? His name begins with an S I\\r\\nthink:--You call him Seymour.\" He paused long between each clause, as\\r\\nif the facts were revealed to him slowly. \"Seymour--Wilbraham--Earl\\r\\nof Strafford. No, not Earl of Strafford! Seymour Wilbraham\\r\\nWentworth. There seems to be some connection in somebody\\'s mind now\\r\\npresent between Wentworth and Strafford. I am not English. I do not\\r\\nknow what it means. But they are somehow the same name, Wentworth\\r\\nand Strafford.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gazed around, apparently for confirmation. A lady came to his\\r\\nrescue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wentworth was the surname of the great Earl of Strafford,\" she\\r\\nmurmured gently; \"and I was wondering, as you spoke, whether\\r\\nMr. Wentworth might possibly be descended from him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is,\" the Seer replied instantly, with a flash of those dark\\r\\neyes. And I thought this curious; for though my father always\\r\\nmaintained the reality of the relationship, there was one link\\r\\nwanting to complete the pedigree. He could not make sure that\\r\\nthe Hon. Thomas Wilbraham Wentworth was the father of Jonathan\\r\\nWentworth, the Bristol horse-dealer, from whom we are descended.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where was I born?\" Sir Charles interrupted, coming suddenly to his\\r\\nown case.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seer clapped his two hands to his forehead and held it between\\r\\nthem, as if to prevent it from bursting. \"Africa,\" he said slowly,\\r\\nas the facts narrowed down, so to speak. \"South Africa; Cape of Good\\r\\nHope; Jansenville; De Witt Street. 1840.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By Jove, he\\'s correct,\" Sir Charles muttered. \"He seems really to\\r\\ndo it. Still, he may have found me out. He may have known where he\\r\\nwas coming.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I never gave a hint,\" I answered; \"till he reached the door, he\\r\\ndidn\\'t even know to what hotel I was piloting him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seer stroked his chin softly. His eye appeared to me to have a\\r\\nfurtive gleam in it. \"Would you like me to tell you the number of\\r\\na bank-note inclosed in an envelope?\" he asked casually.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go out of the room,\" Sir Charles said, \"while I pass it round the\\r\\ncompany.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSe\\xc3\\xb1or Herrera disappeared. Sir Charles passed it round cautiously,\\r\\nholding it all the time in his own hand, but letting his guests see\\r\\nthe number. Then he placed it in an envelope and gummed it down\\r\\nfirmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seer returned. His keen eyes swept the company with a\\r\\ncomprehensive glance. He shook his shaggy mane. Then he took\\r\\nthe envelope in his hands and gazed at it fixedly. \"AF, 73549,\"\\r\\nhe answered, in a slow tone. \"A Bank of England note for fifty\\r\\npounds--exchanged at the Casino for gold won yesterday at\\r\\nMonte Carlo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see how he did that,\" Sir Charles said triumphantly. \"He must\\r\\nhave changed it there himself; and then I changed it back again.\\r\\nIn point of fact, I remember seeing a fellow with long hair loafing\\r\\nabout. Still, it\\'s capital conjuring.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He can see through matter,\" one of the ladies interposed. It was\\r\\nMadame Picardet. \"He can see through a box.\" She drew a little gold\\r\\nvinaigrette, such as our grandmothers used, from her dress-pocket.\\r\\n\"What is in this?\" she inquired, holding it up to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSe\\xc3\\xb1or Herrera gazed through it. \"Three gold coins,\" he replied,\\r\\nknitting his brows with the effort of seeing into the box: \"one,\\r\\nan American five dollars; one, a French ten-franc piece; one,\\r\\ntwenty marks, German, of the old Emperor William.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe opened the box and passed it round. Sir Charles smiled a quiet\\r\\nsmile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Confederacy!\" he muttered, half to himself. \"Confederacy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seer turned to him with a sullen air. \"You want a better sign?\"\\r\\nhe said, in a very impressive voice. \"A sign that will convince you!\\r\\nVery well: you have a letter in your left waistcoat pocket--a\\r\\ncrumpled-up letter. Do you wish me to read it out? I will, if you\\r\\ndesire it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may seem to those who know Sir Charles incredible, but, I am\\r\\nbound to admit, my brother-in-law coloured. What that letter\\r\\ncontained I cannot say; he only answered, very testily and\\r\\nevasively, \"No, thank you; I won\\'t trouble you. The exhibition you\\r\\nhave already given us of your skill in this kind more than amply\\r\\nsuffices.\" And his fingers strayed nervously to his waistcoat\\r\\npocket, as if he was half afraid, even then, Se\\xc3\\xb1or Herrera would\\r\\nread it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fancied, too, he glanced somewhat anxiously towards Madame\\r\\nPicardet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seer bowed courteously. \"Your will, se\\xc3\\xb1or, is law,\" he said. \"I\\r\\nmake it a principle, though I can see through all things, invariably\\r\\nto respect the secrecies and sanctities. If it were not so, I might\\r\\ndissolve society. For which of us is there who could bear the whole\\r\\ntruth being told about him?\" He gazed around the room. An unpleasant\\r\\nthrill supervened. Most of us felt this uncanny Spanish American\\r\\nknew really too much. And some of us were engaged in financial\\r\\noperations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For example,\" the Seer continued blandly, \"I happened a few weeks\\r\\nago to travel down here from Paris by train with a very intelligent\\r\\nman, a company promoter. He had in his bag some documents--some\\r\\nconfidential documents:\" he glanced at Sir Charles. \"You know the\\r\\nkind of thing, my dear sir: reports from experts--from mining\\r\\nengineers. You may have seen some such; marked _strictly private_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They form an element in high finance,\" Sir Charles admitted coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pre-cisely,\" the Seer murmured, his accent for a moment less\\r\\nSpanish than before. \"And, as they were marked _strictly private_,\\r\\nI respect, of course, the seal of confidence. That\\'s all I wish to\\r\\nsay. I hold it a duty, being intrusted with such powers, not to use\\r\\nthem in a manner which may annoy or incommode my fellow-creatures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your feeling does you honour,\" Sir Charles answered, with some\\r\\nacerbity. Then he whispered in my ear: \"Confounded clever scoundrel,\\r\\nSey; rather wish we hadn\\'t brought him here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSe\\xc3\\xb1or Herrera seemed intuitively to divine this wish, for he\\r\\ninterposed, in a lighter and gayer tone--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will now show you a different and more interesting embodiment\\r\\nof occult power, for which we shall need a somewhat subdued\\r\\narrangement of surrounding lights. Would you mind, se\\xc3\\xb1or host--for\\r\\nI have purposely abstained from reading your name on the brain of\\r\\nany one present--would you mind my turning down this lamp just a\\r\\nlittle? ... So! That will do. Now, this one; and this one. Exactly!\\r\\nthat\\'s right.\" He poured a few grains of powder out of a packet into\\r\\na saucer. \"Next, a match, if you please. Thank you!\" It burnt with a\\r\\nstrange green light. He drew from his pocket a card, and produced a\\r\\nlittle ink-bottle. \"Have you a pen?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nI instantly brought one. He handed it to Sir Charles. \"Oblige me,\"\\r\\nhe said, \"by writing your name there.\" And he indicated a place in\\r\\nthe centre of the card, which had an embossed edge, with a small\\r\\nmiddle square of a different colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles has a natural disinclination to signing his name without\\r\\nknowing why. \"What do you want with it?\" he asked. (A millionaire\\'s\\r\\nsignature has so many uses.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I want you to put the card in an envelope,\" the Seer replied, \"and\\r\\nthen to burn it. After that, I shall show you your own name written\\r\\nin letters of blood on my arm, in your own handwriting.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles took the pen. If the signature was to be burned as soon\\r\\nas finished, he didn\\'t mind giving it. He wrote his name in his\\r\\nusual firm clear style--the writing of a man who knows his worth\\r\\nand is not afraid of drawing a cheque for five thousand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look at it long,\" the Seer said, from the other side of the room.\\r\\nHe had not watched him write it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles stared at it fixedly. The Seer was really beginning to\\r\\nproduce an impression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, put it in that envelope,\" the Seer exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles, like a lamb, placed it as directed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seer strode forward. \"Give me the envelope,\" he said. He took it\\r\\nin his hand, walked over towards the fireplace, and solemnly burnt\\r\\nit. \"See--it crumbles into ashes,\" he cried. Then he came back to\\r\\nthe middle of the room, close to the green light, rolled up his\\r\\nsleeve, and held his arm before Sir Charles. There, in blood-red\\r\\nletters, my brother-in-law read the name, \"Charles Vandrift,\" in\\r\\nhis own handwriting!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see how that\\'s done,\" Sir Charles murmured, drawing back. \"It\\'s\\r\\na clever delusion; but still, I see through it. It\\'s like that\\r\\nghost-book. Your ink was deep green; your light was green; you made\\r\\nme look at it long; and then I saw the same thing written on the\\r\\nskin of your arm in complementary colours.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You think so?\" the Seer replied, with a curious curl of the lip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m sure of it,\" Sir Charles answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuick as lightning the Seer again rolled up his sleeve. \"That\\'s\\r\\nyour name,\" he cried, in a very clear voice, \"but not your whole\\r\\nname. What do you say, then, to my right? Is this one also a\\r\\ncomplementary colour?\" He held his other arm out. There, in\\r\\nsea-green letters, I read the name, \"Charles O\\'Sullivan Vandrift.\"\\r\\nIt is my brother-in-law\\'s full baptismal designation; but he has\\r\\ndropped the O\\'Sullivan for many years past, and, to say the truth,\\r\\ndoesn\\'t like it. He is a little bit ashamed of his mother\\'s family.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles glanced at it hurriedly. \"Quite right,\" he said, \"quite\\r\\nright!\" But his voice was hollow. I could guess he didn\\'t care to\\r\\ncontinue the s\\xc3\\xa9ance. He could see through the man, of course; but it\\r\\nwas clear the fellow knew too much about us to be entirely pleasant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Turn up the lights,\" I said, and a servant turned them. \"Shall I\\r\\nsay coffee and benedictine?\" I whispered to Vandrift.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means,\" he answered. \"Anything to keep this fellow from\\r\\nfurther impertinences! And, I say, don\\'t you think you\\'d better\\r\\nsuggest at the same time that the men should smoke? Even these\\r\\nladies are not above a cigarette--some of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a sigh of relief. The lights burned brightly. The Seer for\\r\\nthe moment retired from business, so to speak. He accepted a partaga\\r\\nwith a very good grace, sipped his coffee in a corner, and chatted\\r\\nto the lady who had suggested Strafford with marked politeness. He\\r\\nwas a polished gentleman.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, in the hall of the hotel, I saw Madame Picardet again,\\r\\nin a neat tailor-made travelling dress, evidently bound for the\\r\\nrailway-station.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, off, Madame Picardet?\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled, and held out her prettily-gloved hand. \"Yes, I\\'m off,\"\\r\\nshe answered archly. \"Florence, or Rome, or somewhere. I\\'ve drained\\r\\nNice dry--like a sucked orange. Got all the fun I can out of it.\\r\\nNow I\\'m away again to my beloved Italy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it struck me as odd that, if Italy was her game, she went by the\\r\\nomnibus which takes down to the train de luxe for Paris. However,\\r\\na man of the world accepts what a lady tells him, no matter how\\r\\nimprobable; and I confess, for ten days or so, I thought no more\\r\\nabout her, or the Seer either.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of that time our fortnightly pass-book came in from\\r\\nthe bank in London. It is part of my duty, as the millionaire\\'s\\r\\nsecretary, to make up this book once a fortnight, and to compare\\r\\nthe cancelled cheques with Sir Charles\\'s counterfoils. On this\\r\\nparticular occasion I happened to observe what I can only describe\\r\\nas a very grave discrepancy,--in fact, a discrepancy of 5000 pounds.\\r\\nOn the wrong side, too. Sir Charles was debited with 5000 pounds\\r\\nmore than the total amount that was shown on the counterfoils.\\r\\n\\r\\nI examined the book with care. The source of the error was obvious.\\r\\nIt lay in a cheque to Self or Bearer, for 5000 pounds, signed by Sir\\r\\nCharles, and evidently paid across the counter in London, as it bore\\r\\non its face no stamp or indication of any other office.\\r\\n\\r\\nI called in my brother-in-law from the salon to the study. \"Look\\r\\nhere, Charles,\" I said, \"there\\'s a cheque in the book which you\\r\\nhaven\\'t entered.\" And I handed it to him without comment, for I\\r\\nthought it might have been drawn to settle some little loss on the\\r\\nturf or at cards, or to make up some other affair he didn\\'t desire\\r\\nto mention to me. These things will happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at it and stared hard. Then he pursed up his mouth and\\r\\ngave a long low \"Whew!\" At last he turned it over and remarked,\\r\\n\"I say, Sey, my boy, we\\'ve just been done jolly well brown,\\r\\nhaven\\'t we?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI glanced at the cheque. \"How do you mean?\" I inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, the Seer,\" he replied, still staring at it ruefully. \"I\\r\\ndon\\'t mind the five thou., but to think the fellow should have\\r\\ngammoned the pair of us like that--ignominious, I call it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know it\\'s the Seer?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look at the green ink,\" he answered. \"Besides, I recollect the\\r\\nvery shape of the last flourish. I flourished a bit like that in\\r\\nthe excitement of the moment, which I don\\'t always do with my\\r\\nregular signature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s done us,\" I answered, recognising it. \"But how the dickens\\r\\ndid he manage to transfer it to the cheque? This looks like your\\r\\nown handwriting, Charles, not a clever forgery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is,\" he said. \"I admit it--I can\\'t deny it. Only fancy his\\r\\nbamboozling me when I was most on my guard! I wasn\\'t to be taken\\r\\nin by any of his silly occult tricks and catch-words; but it never\\r\\noccurred to me he was going to victimise me financially in this\\r\\nway. I expected attempts at a loan or an extortion; but to collar\\r\\nmy signature to a blank cheque--atrocious!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did he manage it?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I haven\\'t the faintest conception. I only know those are the\\r\\nwords I wrote. I could swear to them anywhere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you can\\'t protest the cheque?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unfortunately, no; it\\'s my own true signature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went that afternoon without delay to see the Chief Commissary\\r\\nof Police at the office. He was a gentlemanly Frenchman, much less\\r\\nformal and red-tapey than usual, and he spoke excellent English\\r\\nwith an American accent, having acted, in fact, as a detective in\\r\\nNew York for about ten years in his early manhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess,\" he said slowly, after hearing our story, \"you\\'ve been\\r\\nvictimised right here by Colonel Clay, gentlemen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is Colonel Clay?\" Sir Charles asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s just what I want to know,\" the Commissary answered, in\\r\\nhis curious American-French-English. \"He is a Colonel, because he\\r\\noccasionally gives himself a commission; he is called Colonel Clay,\\r\\nbecause he appears to possess an india-rubber face, and he can\\r\\nmould it like clay in the hands of the potter. Real name, unknown.\\r\\nNationality, equally French and English. Address, usually Europe.\\r\\nProfession, former maker of wax figures to the Muse\\xc3\\xa9 Gr\\xc3\\xa9vin. Age,\\r\\nwhat he chooses. Employs his knowledge to mould his own nose\\r\\nand cheeks, with wax additions, to the character he desires to\\r\\npersonate. Aquiline this time, you say. Hein! Anything like these\\r\\nphotographs?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rummaged in his desk and handed us two.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not in the least,\" Sir Charles answered. \"Except, perhaps, as to the\\r\\nneck, everything here is quite unlike him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then that\\'s the Colonel!\" the Commissary answered, with decision,\\r\\nrubbing his hands in glee. \"Look here,\" and he took out a pencil\\r\\nand rapidly sketched the outline of one of the two faces--that of\\r\\na bland-looking young man, with no expression worth mentioning.\\r\\n\"There\\'s the Colonel in his simple disguise. Very good. Now watch\\r\\nme: figure to yourself that he adds here a tiny patch of wax to his\\r\\nnose--an aquiline bridge--just so; well, you have him right there;\\r\\nand the chin, ah, one touch: now, for hair, a wig: for complexion,\\r\\nnothing easier: that\\'s the profile of your rascal, isn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" we both murmured. By two curves of the pencil, and a\\r\\nshock of false hair, the face was transmuted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He had very large eyes, with very big pupils, though,\" I objected,\\r\\nlooking close; \"and the man in the photograph here has them small\\r\\nand boiled-fishy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s so,\" the Commissary answered. \"A drop of belladonna\\r\\nexpands--and produces the Seer; five grains of opium contract--and\\r\\ngive a dead-alive, stupidly-innocent appearance. Well, you leave\\r\\nthis affair to me, gentlemen. I\\'ll see the fun out. I don\\'t say I\\'ll\\r\\ncatch him for you; nobody ever yet has caught Colonel Clay; but\\r\\nI\\'ll explain how he did the trick; and that ought to be consolation\\r\\nenough to a man of your means for a trifle of five thousand!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are not the conventional French office-holder, M. le\\r\\nCommissaire,\" I ventured to interpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You bet!\" the Commissary replied, and drew himself up like a\\r\\ncaptain of infantry. \"Messieurs,\" he continued, in French, with the\\r\\nutmost dignity, \"I shall devote the resources of this office to\\r\\ntracing out the crime, and, if possible, to effectuating the arrest\\r\\nof the culpable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe telegraphed to London, of course, and we wrote to the bank, with\\r\\na full description of the suspected person. But I need hardly add\\r\\nthat nothing came of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree days later the Commissary called at our hotel. \"Well,\\r\\ngentlemen,\" he said, \"I am glad to say I have discovered\\r\\neverything!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What? Arrested the Seer?\" Sir Charles cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commissary drew back, almost horrified at the suggestion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Arrested Colonel Clay?\" he exclaimed. \"Mais, monsieur, we are only\\r\\nhuman! Arrested him? No, not quite. But tracked out how he did it.\\r\\nThat is already much--to unravel Colonel Clay, gentlemen!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what do you make of it?\" Sir Charles asked, crestfallen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commissary sat down and gloated over his discovery. It was\\r\\nclear a well-planned crime amused him vastly. \"In the first place,\\r\\nmonsieur,\" he said, \"disabuse your mind of the idea that when\\r\\nmonsieur your secretary went out to fetch Se\\xc3\\xb1or Herrera that night,\\r\\nSe\\xc3\\xb1or Herrera didn\\'t know to whose rooms he was coming. Quite\\r\\notherwise, in point of fact. I do not doubt myself that Se\\xc3\\xb1or\\r\\nHerrera, or Colonel Clay (call him which you like), came to Nice\\r\\nthis winter for no other purpose than just to rob you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I sent for him,\" my brother-in-law interposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; he _meant_ you to send for him. He forced a card, so to\\r\\nspeak. If he couldn\\'t do that I guess he would be a pretty poor\\r\\nconjurer. He had a lady of his own--his wife, let us say, or his\\r\\nsister--stopping here at this hotel; a certain Madame Picardet.\\r\\nThrough her he induced several ladies of your circle to attend his\\r\\ns\\xc3\\xa9ances. She and they spoke to you about him, and aroused your\\r\\ncuriosity. You may bet your bottom dollar that when he came to\\r\\nthis room he came ready primed and prepared with endless facts\\r\\nabout both of you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What fools we have been, Sey,\" my brother-in-law exclaimed. \"I see\\r\\nit all now. That designing woman sent round before dinner to say I\\r\\nwanted to meet him; and by the time you got there he was ready\\r\\nfor bamboozling me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s so,\" the Commissary answered. \"He had your name ready\\r\\npainted on both his arms; and he had made other preparations of\\r\\nstill greater importance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You mean the cheque. Well, how did he get it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commissary opened the door. \"Come in,\" he said. And a young man\\r\\nentered whom we recognised at once as the chief clerk in the Foreign\\r\\nDepartment of the Cr\\xc3\\xa9dit Marseillais, the principal bank all along\\r\\nthe Riviera.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"State what you know of this cheque,\" the Commissary said, showing\\r\\nit to him, for we had handed it over to the police as a piece of\\r\\nevidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"About four weeks since--\" the clerk began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say ten days before your s\\xc3\\xa9ance,\" the Commissary interposed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A gentleman with very long hair and an aquiline nose, dark,\\r\\nstrange, and handsome, called in at my department and asked if I\\r\\ncould tell him the name of Sir Charles Vandrift\\'s London banker.\\r\\nHe said he had a sum to pay in to your credit, and asked if we\\r\\nwould forward it for him. I told him it was irregular for us to\\r\\nreceive the money, as you had no account with us, but that your\\r\\nLondon bankers were Darby, Drummond, and Rothenberg, Limited.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite right,\" Sir Charles murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two days later a lady, Madame Picardet, who was a customer of ours,\\r\\nbrought in a good cheque for three hundred pounds, signed by a\\r\\nfirst-rate name, and asked us to pay it in on her behalf to Darby,\\r\\nDrummond, and Rothenberg\\'s, and to open a London account with them\\r\\nfor her. We did so, and received in reply a cheque-book.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From which this cheque was taken, as I learn from the number,\\r\\nby telegram from London,\" the Commissary put in. \"Also, that on\\r\\nthe same day on which your cheque was cashed, Madame Picardet,\\r\\nin London, withdrew her balance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But how did the fellow get me to sign the cheque?\" Sir Charles\\r\\ncried. \"How did he manage the card trick?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commissary produced a similar card from his pocket. \"Was that\\r\\nthe sort of thing?\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Precisely! A facsimile.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought so. Well, our Colonel, I find, bought a packet of such\\r\\ncards, intended for admission to a religious function, at a shop\\r\\nin the Quai Massena. He cut out the centre, and, see here--\" The\\r\\nCommissary turned it over, and showed a piece of paper pasted neatly\\r\\nover the back; this he tore off, and there, concealed behind it, lay\\r\\na folded cheque, with only the place where the signature should be\\r\\nwritten showing through on the face which the Seer had presented\\r\\nto us. \"I call that a neat trick,\" the Commissary remarked, with\\r\\nprofessional enjoyment of a really good deception.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he burnt the envelope before my eyes,\" Sir Charles exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pooh!\" the Commissary answered. \"What would he be worth as a\\r\\nconjurer, anyway, if he couldn\\'t substitute one envelope for another\\r\\nbetween the table and the fireplace without your noticing it? And\\r\\nColonel Clay, you must remember, is a prince among conjurers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, it\\'s a comfort to know we\\'ve identified our man, and the\\r\\nwoman who was with him,\" Sir Charles said, with a slight sigh of\\r\\nrelief. \"The next thing will be, of course, you\\'ll follow them up\\r\\non these clues in England and arrest them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commissary shrugged his shoulders. \"Arrest them!\" he exclaimed,\\r\\nmuch amused. \"Ah, monsieur, but you are sanguine! No officer of\\r\\njustice has ever succeeded in arresting le Colonel Caoutchouc, as\\r\\nwe call him in French. He is as slippery as an eel, that man. He\\r\\nwriggles through our fingers. Suppose even we caught him, what could\\r\\nwe prove? I ask you. Nobody who has seen him once can ever swear\\r\\nto him again in his next impersonation. He is impayable, this good\\r\\nColonel. On the day when I arrest him, I assure you, monsieur, I\\r\\nshall consider myself the smartest police-officer in Europe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I shall catch him yet,\" Sir Charles answered, and relapsed\\r\\ninto silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE DIAMOND LINKS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us take a trip to Switzerland,\" said Lady Vandrift. And any one\\r\\nwho knows Amelia will not be surprised to learn that we _did_ take a\\r\\ntrip to Switzerland accordingly. Nobody can drive Sir Charles, except\\r\\nhis wife. And nobody at all can drive Amelia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were difficulties at the outset, because we had not ordered\\r\\nrooms at the hotels beforehand, and it was well on in the season;\\r\\nbut they were overcome at last by the usual application of a golden\\r\\nkey; and we found ourselves in due time pleasantly quartered in\\r\\nLucerne, at that most comfortable of European hostelries, the\\r\\nSchweitzerhof.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were a square party of four--Sir Charles and Amelia, myself and\\r\\nIsabel. We had nice big rooms, on the first floor, overlooking the\\r\\nlake; and as none of us was possessed with the faintest symptom of\\r\\nthat incipient mania which shows itself in the form of an insane\\r\\ndesire to climb mountain heights of disagreeable steepness and\\r\\nunnecessary snowiness, I will venture to assert we all enjoyed\\r\\nourselves. We spent most of our time sensibly in lounging about the\\r\\nlake on the jolly little steamers; and when we did a mountain climb,\\r\\nit was on the Rigi or Pilatus--where an engine undertook all the\\r\\nmuscular work for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs usual, at the hotel, a great many miscellaneous people showed a\\r\\nburning desire to be specially nice to us. If you wish to see how\\r\\nfriendly and charming humanity is, just try being a well-known\\r\\nmillionaire for a week, and you\\'ll learn a thing or two. Wherever\\r\\nSir Charles goes he is surrounded by charming and disinterested\\r\\npeople, all eager to make his distinguished acquaintance, and all\\r\\nfamiliar with several excellent investments, or several deserving\\r\\nobjects of Christian charity. It is my business in life, as his\\r\\nbrother-in-law and secretary, to decline with thanks the excellent\\r\\ninvestments, and to throw judicious cold water on the objects of\\r\\ncharity. Even I myself, as the great man\\'s almoner, am very much\\r\\nsought after. People casually allude before me to artless stories\\r\\nof \"poor curates in Cumberland, you know, Mr. Wentworth,\" or widows\\r\\nin Cornwall, penniless poets with epics in their desks, and young\\r\\npainters who need but the breath of a patron to open to them the\\r\\ndoors of an admiring Academy. I smile and look wise, while I\\r\\nadminister cold water in minute doses; but I never report one of\\r\\nthese cases to Sir Charles, except in the rare or almost unheard-of\\r\\nevent where I think there is really something in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since our little adventure with the Seer at Nice, Sir Charles,\\r\\nwho is constitutionally cautious, had been even more careful than\\r\\nusual about possible sharpers. And, as chance would have it, there\\r\\nsat just opposite us at table d\\'h\\xc3\\xb4te at the Schweitzerhof--\\'tis\\r\\na fad of Amelia\\'s to dine at table d\\'h\\xc3\\xb4te; she says she can\\'t bear\\r\\nto be boxed up all day in private rooms with \"too much family\"--a\\r\\nsinister-looking man with dark hair and eyes, conspicuous by his\\r\\nbushy overhanging eyebrows. My attention was first called to the\\r\\neyebrows in question by a nice little parson who sat at our side,\\r\\nand who observed that they were made up of certain large and bristly\\r\\nhairs, which (he told us) had been traced by Darwin to our monkey\\r\\nancestors. Very pleasant little fellow, this fresh-faced young\\r\\nparson, on his honeymoon tour with a nice wee wife, a bonnie Scotch\\r\\nlassie with a charming accent.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at the eyebrows close. Then a sudden thought struck me. \"Do\\r\\nyou believe they\\'re his own?\" I asked of the curate; \"or are they\\r\\nonly stuck on--a make-up disguise? They really almost look like it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You don\\'t suppose--\" Charles began, and checked himself suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, I do,\" I answered; \"the Seer!\" Then I recollected my blunder,\\r\\nand looked down sheepishly. For, to say the truth, Vandrift had\\r\\nstraightly enjoined on me long before to say nothing of our painful\\r\\nlittle episode at Nice to Amelia; he was afraid if _she_ once heard\\r\\nof it, _he_ would hear of it for ever after.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What Seer?\" the little parson inquired, with parsonical curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI noticed the man with the overhanging eyebrows give a queer sort\\r\\nof start. Charles\\'s glance was fixed upon me. I hardly knew what\\r\\nto answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, a man who was at Nice with us last year,\" I stammered out,\\r\\ntrying hard to look unconcerned. \"A fellow they talked about,\\r\\nthat\\'s all.\" And I turned the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the curate, like a donkey, wouldn\\'t let me turn it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Had he eyebrows like that?\" he inquired, in an undertone. I was\\r\\nreally angry. If this _was_ Colonel Clay, the curate was obviously\\r\\ngiving him the cue, and making it much more difficult for us to\\r\\ncatch him, now we might possibly have lighted on the chance of\\r\\ndoing so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, he hadn\\'t,\" I answered testily; \"it was a passing expression.\\r\\nBut this is not the man. I was mistaken, no doubt.\" And I nudged\\r\\nhim gently.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little curate was too innocent for anything. \"Oh, I see,\" he\\r\\nreplied, nodding hard and looking wise. Then he turned to his wife\\r\\nand made an obvious face, which the man with the eyebrows couldn\\'t\\r\\nfail to notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately, a political discussion going on a few places farther\\r\\ndown the table spread up to us and diverted attention for a moment.\\r\\nThe magical name of Gladstone saved us. Sir Charles flared up. I\\r\\nwas truly pleased, for I could see Amelia was boiling over with\\r\\ncuriosity by this time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner, in the billiard-room, however, the man with the big\\r\\neyebrows sidled up and began to talk to me. If he _was_ Colonel\\r\\nClay, it was evident he bore us no grudge at all for the five\\r\\nthousand pounds he had done us out of. On the contrary, he seemed\\r\\nquite prepared to do us out of five thousand more when opportunity\\r\\noffered; for he introduced himself at once as Dr. Hector Macpherson,\\r\\nthe exclusive grantee of extensive concessions from the Brazilian\\r\\nGovernment on the Upper Amazons. He dived into conversation with\\r\\nme at once as to the splendid mineral resources of his Brazilian\\r\\nestate--the silver, the platinum, the actual rubies, the possible\\r\\ndiamonds. I listened and smiled; I knew what was coming. All he\\r\\nneeded to develop this magnificent concession was a little more\\r\\ncapital. It was sad to see thousands of pounds\\' worth of platinum\\r\\nand car-loads of rubies just crumbling in the soil or carried away\\r\\nby the river, for want of a few hundreds to work them with properly.\\r\\nIf he knew of anybody, now, with money to invest, he could recommend\\r\\nhim--nay, offer him--a unique opportunity of earning, say, 40 per\\r\\ncent on his capital, on unimpeachable security.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t do it for every man,\" Dr. Hector Macpherson remarked,\\r\\ndrawing himself up; \"but if I took a fancy to a fellow who had\\r\\ncommand of ready cash, I might choose to put him in the way of\\r\\nfeathering his nest with unexampled rapidity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exceedingly disinterested of you,\" I answered drily, fixing my\\r\\neyes on his eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little curate, meanwhile, was playing billiards with Sir\\r\\nCharles. His glance followed mine as it rested for a moment on\\r\\nthe monkey-like hairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"False, obviously false,\" he remarked with his lips; and I\\'m bound\\r\\nto confess I never saw any man speak so well by movement alone;\\r\\nyou could follow every word though not a sound escaped him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the rest of that evening Dr. Hector Macpherson stuck to me\\r\\nas close as a mustard-plaster. And he was almost as irritating. I\\r\\ngot heartily sick of the Upper Amazons. I have positively waded in\\r\\nmy time through ruby mines (in prospectuses, I mean) till the mere\\r\\nsight of a ruby absolutely sickens me. When Charles, in an unwonted\\r\\nfit of generosity, once gave his sister Isabel (whom I had the\\r\\nhonour to marry) a ruby necklet (inferior stones), I made Isabel\\r\\nchange it for sapphires and amethysts, on the judicious plea that\\r\\nthey suited her complexion better. (I scored one, incidentally, for\\r\\nhaving considered Isabel\\'s complexion.) By the time I went to bed\\r\\nI was prepared to sink the Upper Amazons in the sea, and to stab,\\r\\nshoot, poison, or otherwise seriously damage the man with the\\r\\nconcession and the false eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next three days, at intervals, he returned to the charge. He\\r\\nbored me to death with his platinum and his rubies. He didn\\'t want a\\r\\ncapitalist who would personally exploit the thing; he would prefer\\r\\nto do it all on his own account, giving the capitalist preference\\r\\ndebentures of his bogus company, and a lien on the concession. I\\r\\nlistened and smiled; I listened and yawned; I listened and was rude;\\r\\nI ceased to listen at all; but still he droned on with it. I fell\\r\\nasleep on the steamer one day, and woke up in ten minutes to hear\\r\\nhim droning yet, \"And the yield of platinum per ton was certified\\r\\nto be--\" I forget how many pounds, or ounces, or pennyweights.\\r\\nThese details of assays have ceased to interest me: like the man\\r\\nwho \"didn\\'t believe in ghosts,\" I have seen too many of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fresh-faced little curate and his wife, however, were quite\\r\\ndifferent people. He was a cricketing Oxford man; she was a breezy\\r\\nScotch lass, with a wholesome breath of the Highlands about her. I\\r\\ncalled her \"White Heather.\" Their name was Brabazon. Millionaires\\r\\nare so accustomed to being beset by harpies of every description,\\r\\nthat when they come across a young couple who are simple and\\r\\nnatural, they delight in the purely human relation. We picnicked\\r\\nand went excursions a great deal with the honeymooners. They were\\r\\nso frank in their young love, and so proof against chaff, that we\\r\\nall really liked them. But whenever I called the pretty girl \"White\\r\\nHeather,\" she looked so shocked, and cried: \"Oh, Mr. Wentworth!\"\\r\\nStill, we were the best of friends. The curate offered to row us in\\r\\na boat on the lake one day, while the Scotch lassie assured us she\\r\\ncould take an oar almost as well as he did. However, we did not\\r\\naccept their offer, as row-boats exert an unfavourable influence\\r\\nupon Amelia\\'s digestive organs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nice young fellow, that man Brabazon,\" Sir Charles said to me one\\r\\nday, as we lounged together along the quay; \"never talks about\\r\\nadvowsons or next presentations. Doesn\\'t seem to me to care two pins\\r\\nabout promotion. Says he\\'s quite content in his country curacy;\\r\\nenough to live upon, and needs no more; and his wife has a little, a\\r\\nvery little, money. I asked him about his poor to-day, on purpose to\\r\\ntest him: these parsons are always trying to screw something out of\\r\\none for their poor; men in my position know the truth of the saying\\r\\nthat we have that class of the population always with us. Would\\r\\nyou believe it, he says he hasn\\'t any poor at all in his parish!\\r\\nThey\\'re all well-to-do farmers or else able-bodied labourers, and\\r\\nhis one terror is that somebody will come and try to pauperise them.\\r\\n\\'If a philanthropist were to give me fifty pounds to-day for use at\\r\\nEmpingham,\\' he said, \\'I assure you, Sir Charles, I shouldn\\'t know\\r\\nwhat to do with it. I think I should buy new dresses for Jessie, who\\r\\nwants them about as much as anybody else in the village--that is to\\r\\nsay, not at all.\\' There\\'s a parson for you, Sey, my boy. Only wish\\r\\nwe had one of his sort at Seldon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He certainly doesn\\'t want to get anything out of you,\" I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening at dinner a queer little episode happened. The man\\r\\nwith the eyebrows began talking to me across the table in his usual\\r\\nfashion, full of his wearisome concession on the Upper Amazons. I\\r\\nwas trying to squash him as politely as possible, when I caught\\r\\nAmelia\\'s eye. Her look amused me. She was engaged in making signals\\r\\nto Charles at her side to observe the little curate\\'s curious\\r\\nsleeve-links. I glanced at them, and saw at once they were a\\r\\nsingular possession for so unobtrusive a person. They consisted\\r\\neach of a short gold bar for one arm of the link, fastened by a\\r\\ntiny chain of the same material to what seemed to my tolerably\\r\\nexperienced eye--a first-rate diamond. Pretty big diamonds, too,\\r\\nand of remarkable shape, brilliancy, and cutting. In a moment I\\r\\nknew what Amelia meant. She owned a diamond rivi\\xc3\\xa8re, said to be\\r\\nof Indian origin, but short by two stones for the circumference\\r\\nof her tolerably ample neck. Now, she had long been wanting two\\r\\ndiamonds like these to match her set; but owing to the unusual\\r\\nshape and antiquated cutting of her own gems, she had never\\r\\nbeen able to complete the necklet, at least without removing an\\r\\nextravagant amount from a much larger stone of the first water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scotch lassie\\'s eyes caught Amelia\\'s at the same time, and she\\r\\nbroke into a pretty smile of good-humoured amusement. \"Taken in\\r\\nanother person, Dick, dear!\" she exclaimed, in her breezy way,\\r\\nturning to her husband. \"Lady Vandrift is observing your diamond\\r\\nsleeve-links.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They\\'re very fine gems,\" Amelia observed incautiously. (A most\\r\\nunwise admission if she desired to buy them.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the pleasant little curate was too transparently simple a soul\\r\\nto take advantage of her slip of judgment. \"They _are_ good stones,\"\\r\\nhe replied; \"very good stones--considering. They\\'re not diamonds\\r\\nat all, to tell you the truth. They\\'re best old-fashioned Oriental\\r\\npaste. My great-grandfather bought them, after the siege of\\r\\nSeringapatam, for a few rupees, from a Sepoy who had looted them\\r\\nfrom Tippoo Sultan\\'s palace. He thought, like you, he had got a good\\r\\nthing. But it turned out, when they came to be examined by experts,\\r\\nthey were only paste--very wonderful paste; it is supposed they had\\r\\neven imposed upon Tippoo himself, so fine is the imitation. But they\\r\\nare worth--well, say, fifty shillings at the utmost.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he spoke Charles looked at Amelia, and Amelia looked at\\r\\nCharles. Their eyes spoke volumes. The rivi\\xc3\\xa8re was also supposed to\\r\\nhave come from Tippoo\\'s collection. Both drew at once an identical\\r\\nconclusion. These were two of the same stones, very likely torn\\r\\napart and disengaged from the rest in the m\\xc3\\xaal\\xc3\\xa9e at the capture of\\r\\nthe Indian palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you take them off?\" Sir Charles asked blandly. He spoke in\\r\\nthe tone that indicates business.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" the little curate answered, smiling. \"I\\'m accustomed to\\r\\ntaking them off. They\\'re always noticed. They\\'ve been kept in the\\r\\nfamily ever since the siege, as a sort of valueless heirloom, for\\r\\nthe sake of the picturesqueness of the story, you know; and nobody\\r\\never sees them without asking, as you do, to examine them closely.\\r\\nThey deceive even experts at first. But they\\'re paste, all the same;\\r\\nunmitigated Oriental paste, for all that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took them both off, and handed them to Charles. No man in England\\r\\nis a finer judge of gems than my brother-in-law. I watched him\\r\\nnarrowly. He examined them close, first with the naked eye, then\\r\\nwith the little pocket-lens which he always carries. \"Admirable\\r\\nimitation,\" he muttered, passing them on to Amelia. \"I\\'m not\\r\\nsurprised they should impose upon inexperienced observers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut from the tone in which he said it, I could see at once he had\\r\\nsatisfied himself they were real gems of unusual value. I know\\r\\nCharles\\'s way of doing business so well. His glance to Amelia meant,\\r\\n\"These are the very stones you have so long been in search of.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scotch lassie laughed a merry laugh. \"He sees through them\\r\\nnow, Dick,\" she cried. \"I felt sure Sir Charles would be a judge\\r\\nof diamonds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmelia turned them over. I know Amelia, too; and I knew from the\\r\\nway Amelia looked at them that she meant to have them. And when\\r\\nAmelia means to have anything, people who stand in the way may just\\r\\nas well spare themselves the trouble of opposing her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were beautiful diamonds. We found out afterwards the little\\r\\ncurate\\'s account was quite correct: these stones _had_ come from\\r\\nthe same necklet as Amelia\\'s rivi\\xc3\\xa8re, made for a favourite wife of\\r\\nTippoo\\'s, who had presumably as expansive personal charms as our\\r\\nbeloved sister-in-law\\'s. More perfect diamonds have seldom been\\r\\nseen. They have excited the universal admiration of thieves and\\r\\nconnoisseurs. Amelia told me afterwards that, according to legend,\\r\\na Sepoy stole the necklet at the sack of the palace, and then fought\\r\\nwith another for it. It was believed that two stones got spilt\\r\\nin the scuffle, and were picked up and sold by a third person--a\\r\\nlooker-on--who had no idea of the value of his booty. Amelia had\\r\\nbeen hunting for them for several years to complete her necklet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are excellent paste,\" Sir Charles observed, handing them back.\\r\\n\"It takes a first-rate judge to detect them from the reality. Lady\\r\\nVandrift has a necklet much the same in character, but composed\\r\\nof genuine stones; and as these are so much like them, and would\\r\\ncomplete her set, to all outer appearance, I wouldn\\'t mind giving\\r\\nyou, say, 10 pounds for the pair of them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Brabazon looked delighted. \"Oh, sell them to him, Dick,\" she\\r\\ncried, \"and buy me a brooch with the money! A pair of common\\r\\nlinks would do for you just as well. Ten pounds for two paste\\r\\nstones! It\\'s quite a lot of money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said it so sweetly, with her pretty Scotch accent, that I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t imagine how Dick had the heart to refuse her. But he\\r\\ndid, all the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Jess, darling,\" he answered. \"They\\'re worthless, I know; but\\r\\nthey have for me a certain sentimental value, as I\\'ve often told\\r\\nyou. My dear mother wore them, while she lived, as ear-rings; and\\r\\nas soon as she died I had them set as links in order that I might\\r\\nalways keep them about me. Besides, they have historical and family\\r\\ninterest. Even a worthless heirloom, after all, _is_ an heirloom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Hector Macpherson looked across and intervened. \"There is a\\r\\npart of my concession,\" he said, \"where we have reason to believe a\\r\\nperfect new Kimberley will soon be discovered. If at any time you\\r\\nwould care, Sir Charles, to look at my diamonds--when I get them--it\\r\\nwould afford me the greatest pleasure in life to submit them to your\\r\\nconsideration.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles could stand it no longer. \"Sir,\" he said, gazing across\\r\\nat him with his sternest air, \"if your concession were as full of\\r\\ndiamonds as Sindbad the Sailor\\'s valley, I would not care to turn my\\r\\nhead to look at them. I am acquainted with the nature and practice\\r\\nof salting.\" And he glared at the man with the overhanging eyebrows\\r\\nas if he would devour him raw. Poor Dr. Hector Macpherson subsided\\r\\ninstantly. We learnt a little later that he was a harmless lunatic,\\r\\nwho went about the world with successive concessions for ruby mines\\r\\nand platinum reefs, because he had been ruined and driven mad by\\r\\nspeculations in the two, and now recouped himself by imaginary\\r\\ngrants in Burmah and Brazil, or anywhere else that turned up handy.\\r\\nAnd his eyebrows, after all, were of Nature\\'s handicraft. We were\\r\\nsorry for the incident; but a man in Sir Charles\\'s position is such\\r\\na mark for rogues that, if he did not take means to protect himself\\r\\npromptly, he would be for ever overrun by them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we went up to our salon that evening, Amelia flung herself on\\r\\nthe sofa. \"Charles,\" she broke out in the voice of a tragedy queen,\\r\\n\"those are real diamonds, and I shall never be happy again till I\\r\\nget them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are real diamonds,\" Charles echoed. \"And you shall have them,\\r\\nAmelia. They\\'re worth not less than three thousand pounds. But I\\r\\nshall bid them up gently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, next day, Charles set to work to higgle with the curate.\\r\\nBrabazon, however, didn\\'t care to part with them. He was no\\r\\nmoney-grubber, he said. He cared more for his mother\\'s gift and a\\r\\nfamily tradition than for a hundred pounds, if Sir Charles were to\\r\\noffer it. Charles\\'s eye gleamed. \"But if I give you _two_ hundred!\"\\r\\nhe said insinuatingly. \"What opportunities for good! You could\\r\\nbuild a new wing to your village school-house!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have ample accommodation,\" the curate answered. \"No, I don\\'t\\r\\nthink I\\'ll sell them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, his voice faltered somewhat, and he looked down at them\\r\\ninquiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was too precipitate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A hundred pounds more or less matters little to me,\" he said; \"and\\r\\nmy wife has set her heart on them. It\\'s every man\\'s duty to please\\r\\nhis wife--isn\\'t it, Mrs. Brabazon?--I offer you three hundred.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Scotch girl clasped her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three hundred pounds! Oh, Dick, just think what fun we could have,\\r\\nand what good we could do with it! Do let him have them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer accent was irresistible. But the curate shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible,\" he answered. \"My dear mother\\'s ear-rings! Uncle\\r\\nAubrey would be so angry if he knew I\\'d sold them. I daren\\'t face\\r\\nUncle Aubrey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Has he expectations from Uncle Aubrey?\" Sir Charles asked of\\r\\nWhite Heather.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Brabazon laughed. \"Uncle Aubrey! Oh, dear, no. Poor dear old\\r\\nUncle Aubrey! Why, the darling old soul hasn\\'t a penny to bless\\r\\nhimself with, except his pension. He\\'s a retired post captain.\"\\r\\nAnd she laughed melodiously. She was a charming woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I should disregard Uncle Aubrey\\'s feelings,\" Sir Charles\\r\\nsaid decisively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no,\" the curate answered. \"Poor dear old Uncle Aubrey! I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t do anything for the world to annoy him. And he\\'d be sure\\r\\nto notice it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went back to Amelia. \"Well, have you got them?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" Sir Charles answered. \"Not yet. But he\\'s coming round, I\\r\\nthink. He\\'s hesitating now. Would rather like to sell them himself,\\r\\nbut is afraid what \\'Uncle Aubrey\\' would say about the matter. His\\r\\nwife will talk him out of his needless consideration for Uncle\\r\\nAubrey\\'s feelings; and to-morrow we\\'ll finally clench the bargain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning we stayed late in our salon, where we always\\r\\nbreakfasted, and did not come down to the public rooms till just\\r\\nbefore d\\xc3\\xa9je\\xc3\\xbbner, Sir Charles being busy with me over arrears of\\r\\ncorrespondence. When we _did_ come down the concierge stepped\\r\\nforward with a twisted little feminine note for Amelia. She took\\r\\nit and read it. Her countenance fell. \"There, Charles,\" she cried,\\r\\nhanding it to him, \"you\\'ve let the chance slip. I shall _never_ be\\r\\nhappy now! They\\'ve gone off with the diamonds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles seized the note and read it. Then he passed it on to me.\\r\\nIt was short, but final:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thursday, 6 a.m.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR LADY VANDRIFT--_Will_ you kindly excuse our having gone off\\r\\nhurriedly without bidding you good-bye? We have just had a horrid\\r\\ntelegram to say that Dick\\'s favourite sister is _dangerously_ ill of\\r\\nfever in Paris. I wanted to shake hands with you before we left--you\\r\\nhave all been so sweet to us--but we go by the morning train,\\r\\nabsurdly early, and I wouldn\\'t for worlds disturb you. Perhaps some\\r\\nday we may meet again--though, buried as we are in a North-country\\r\\nvillage, it isn\\'t likely; but in any case, you have secured the\\r\\ngrateful recollection of Yours very cordially, JESSIE BRABAZON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"P.S.--Kindest regards to Sir Charles and those _dear_ Wentworths,\\r\\nand a kiss for yourself, if I may venture to send you one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She doesn\\'t even mention where they\\'ve gone,\" Amelia exclaimed,\\r\\nin a very bad humour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The concierge may know,\" Isabel suggested, looking over my\\r\\nshoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe asked at his office.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, the gentleman\\'s address was the Rev. Richard Peploe Brabazon,\\r\\nHolme Bush Cottage, Empingham, Northumberland.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny address where letters might be sent at once, in Paris?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next ten days, or till further notice, H\\xc3\\xb4tel des Deux\\r\\nMondes, Avenue de l\\'Op\\xc3\\xa9ra.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmelia\\'s mind was made up at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strike while the iron\\'s hot,\" she cried. \"This sudden illness,\\r\\ncoming at the end of their honeymoon, and involving ten days\\' more\\r\\nstay at an expensive hotel, will probably upset the curate\\'s budget.\\r\\nHe\\'ll be glad to sell now. You\\'ll get them for three hundred. It\\r\\nwas absurd of Charles to offer so much at first; but offered once,\\r\\nof course we must stick to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you propose to do?\" Charles asked. \"Write, or telegraph?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, how silly men are!\" Amelia cried. \"Is this the sort of business\\r\\nto be arranged by letter, still less by telegram? No. Seymour must\\r\\nstart off at once, taking the night train to Paris; and the moment\\r\\nhe gets there, he must interview the curate or Mrs. Brabazon. Mrs.\\r\\nBrabazon\\'s the best. She has none of this stupid, sentimental\\r\\nnonsense about Uncle Aubrey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is no part of a secretary\\'s duties to act as a diamond broker.\\r\\nBut when Amelia puts her foot down, she puts her foot down--a fact\\r\\nwhich she is unnecessarily fond of emphasising in that identical\\r\\nproposition. So the self-same evening saw me safe in the train on\\r\\nmy way to Paris; and next morning I turned out of my comfortable\\r\\nsleeping-car at the Gare de Strasbourg. My orders were to bring back\\r\\nthose diamonds, alive or dead, so to speak, in my pocket to Lucerne;\\r\\nand to offer any needful sum, up to two thousand five hundred\\r\\npounds, for their immediate purchase.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I arrived at the Deux Mondes I found the poor little curate\\r\\nand his wife both greatly agitated. They had sat up all night, they\\r\\nsaid, with their invalid sister; and the sleeplessness and suspense\\r\\nhad certainly told upon them after their long railway journey. They\\r\\nwere pale and tired, Mrs. Brabazon, in particular, looking ill and\\r\\nworried--too much like White Heather. I was more than half ashamed\\r\\nof bothering them about the diamonds at such a moment, but it\\r\\noccurred to me that Amelia was probably right--they would now have\\r\\nreached the end of the sum set apart for their Continental trip,\\r\\nand a little ready cash might be far from unwelcome.\\r\\n\\r\\nI broached the subject delicately. It was a fad of Lady Vandrift\\'s,\\r\\nI said. She had set her heart upon those useless trinkets. And she\\r\\nwouldn\\'t go without them. She must and would have them. But the\\r\\ncurate was obdurate. He threw Uncle Aubrey still in my teeth. Three\\r\\nhundred?--no, never! A mother\\'s present; impossible, dear Jessie!\\r\\nJessie begged and prayed; she had grown really attached to Lady\\r\\nVandrift, she said; but the curate wouldn\\'t hear of it. I went up\\r\\ntentatively to four hundred. He shook his head gloomily. It wasn\\'t\\r\\na question of money, he said. It was a question of affection. I saw\\r\\nit was no use trying that tack any longer. I struck out a new line.\\r\\n\"These stones,\" I said, \"I think I ought to inform you, are really\\r\\ndiamonds. Sir Charles is certain of it. Now, is it right for a man\\r\\nof your profession and position to be wearing a pair of big gems\\r\\nlike those, worth several hundred pounds, as ordinary sleeve-links?\\r\\nA woman?--yes, I grant you. But for a man, is it manly? And you a\\r\\ncricketer!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at me and laughed. \"Will nothing convince you?\" he cried.\\r\\n\"They have been examined and tested by half a dozen jewellers, and\\r\\nwe know them to be paste. It wouldn\\'t be right of me to sell them\\r\\nto you under false pretences, however unwilling on my side. I\\r\\n_couldn\\'t_ do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" I said, going up a bit in my bids to meet him,\\r\\n\"I\\'ll put it like this. These gems are paste. But Lady Vandrift\\r\\nhas an unconquerable and unaccountable desire to possess them.\\r\\nMoney doesn\\'t matter to her. She is a friend of your wife\\'s. As a\\r\\npersonal favour, won\\'t you sell them to her for a thousand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head. \"It would be wrong,\" he said,--\"I might even add,\\r\\ncriminal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we take all risk,\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was absolute adamant. \"As a clergyman,\" he answered, \"I feel\\r\\nI cannot do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will _you_ try, Mrs. Brabazon?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pretty little Scotchwoman leant over and whispered. She coaxed\\r\\nand cajoled him. Her ways were winsome. I couldn\\'t hear what she\\r\\nsaid, but he seemed to give way at last. \"I should love Lady\\r\\nVandrift to have them,\" she murmured, turning to me. \"She _is_ such\\r\\na dear!\" And she took out the links from her husband\\'s cuffs and\\r\\nhanded them across to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How much?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two thousand?\" she answered, interrogatively. It was a big rise,\\r\\nall at once; but such are the ways of women.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Done!\" I replied. \"Do you consent?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe curate looked up as if ashamed of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I consent,\" he said slowly, \"since Jessie wishes it. But as a\\r\\nclergyman, and to prevent any future misunderstanding, I should\\r\\nlike you to give me a statement in writing that you buy them on my\\r\\ndistinct and positive declaration that they are made of paste--old\\r\\nOriental paste--not genuine stones, and that I do not claim any\\r\\nother qualities for them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI popped the gems into my purse, well pleased.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" I said, pulling out a paper. Charles, with his\\r\\nunerring business instinct, had anticipated the request, and given\\r\\nme a signed agreement to that effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will take a cheque?\" I inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Notes of the Bank of France would suit me better,\" he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well,\" I replied. \"I will go out and get them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow very unsuspicious some people are! He allowed me to go off--with\\r\\nthe stones in my pocket!\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles had given me a blank cheque, not exceeding two thousand\\r\\nfive hundred pounds. I took it to our agents and cashed it for notes\\r\\nof the Bank of France. The curate clasped them with pleasure. And\\r\\nright glad I was to go back to Lucerne that night, feeling that I\\r\\nhad got those diamonds into my hands for about a thousand pounds\\r\\nunder their real value!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Lucerne railway station Amelia met me. She was positively\\r\\nagitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you bought them, Seymour?\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" I answered, producing my spoils in triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, how dreadful!\" she cried, drawing back. \"Do you think they\\'re\\r\\nreal? Are you sure he hasn\\'t cheated you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certain of it,\" I replied, examining them. \"No one can take me in,\\r\\nin the matter of diamonds. Why on earth should you doubt them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because I\\'ve been talking to Mrs. O\\'Hagan, at the hotel, and she\\r\\nsays there\\'s a well-known trick just like that--she\\'s read of it in\\r\\na book. A swindler has two sets--one real, one false; and he makes\\r\\nyou buy the false ones by showing you the real, and pretending he\\r\\nsells them as a special favour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You needn\\'t be alarmed,\" I answered. \"I am a judge of diamonds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shan\\'t be satisfied,\" Amelia murmured, \"till Charles has seen\\r\\nthem.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went up to the hotel. For the first time in her life I saw Amelia\\r\\nreally nervous as I handed the stones to Charles to examine. Her\\r\\ndoubt was contagious. I half feared, myself, he might break out into\\r\\na deep monosyllabic interjection, losing his temper in haste, as he\\r\\noften does when things go wrong. But he looked at them with a smile,\\r\\nwhile I told him the price.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eight hundred pounds less than their value,\" he answered, well\\r\\nsatisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You have no doubt of their reality?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not the slightest,\" he replied, gazing at them. \"They are genuine\\r\\nstones, precisely the same in quality and type as Amelia\\'s necklet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmelia drew a sigh of relief. \"I\\'ll go upstairs,\" she said slowly,\\r\\n\"and bring down my own for you both to compare with them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne minute later she rushed down again, breathless. Amelia is far\\r\\nfrom slim, and I never before knew her exert herself so actively.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Charles, Charles!\" she cried, \"do you know what dreadful thing\\r\\nhas happened? Two of my own stones are gone. He\\'s stolen a couple\\r\\nof diamonds from my necklet, and sold them back to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe held out the rivi\\xc3\\xa8re. It was all too true. Two gems were\\r\\nmissing--and these two just fitted the empty places!\\r\\n\\r\\nA light broke in upon me. I clapped my hand to my head. \"By Jove,\"\\r\\nI exclaimed, \"the little curate is--Colonel Clay!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles clapped his own hand to his brow in turn. \"And Jessie,\" he\\r\\ncried, \"White Heather--that innocent little Scotchwoman! I often\\r\\ndetected a familiar ring in her voice, in spite of the charming\\r\\nHighland accent. Jessie is--Madame Picardet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had absolutely no evidence; but, like the Commissary at Nice,\\r\\nwe felt instinctively sure of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles was determined to catch the rogue. This second deception\\r\\nput him on his mettle. \"The worst of the man is,\" he said, \"he has a\\r\\nmethod. He doesn\\'t go out of his way to cheat us; he makes us go out\\r\\nof ours to be cheated. He lays a trap, and we tumble headlong into\\r\\nit. To-morrow, Sey, we must follow him on to Paris.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmelia explained to him what Mrs. O\\'Hagan had said. Charles took it\\r\\nall in at once, with his usual sagacity. \"That explains,\" he said,\\r\\n\"why the rascal used this particular trick to draw us on by. If we\\r\\nhad suspected him he could have shown the diamonds were real, and\\r\\nso escaped detection. It was a blind to draw us off from the fact\\r\\nof the robbery. He went to Paris to be out of the way when the\\r\\ndiscovery was made, and to get a clear day\\'s start of us. What a\\r\\nconsummate rogue! And to do me twice running!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did he get at my jewel-case, though?\" Amelia exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the question,\" Charles answered. \"You _do_ leave it about so!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why didn\\'t he steal the whole rivi\\xc3\\xa8re at once, and sell the\\r\\ngems?\" I inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Too cunning,\" Charles replied. \"This was much better business. It\\r\\nisn\\'t easy to dispose of a big thing like that. In the first place,\\r\\nthe stones are large and valuable; in the second place, they\\'re\\r\\nwell known--every dealer has heard of the Vandrift rivi\\xc3\\xa8re, and seen\\r\\npictures of the shape of them. They\\'re marked gems, so to speak. No,\\r\\nhe played a better game--took a couple of them off, and offered them\\r\\nto the only one person on earth who was likely to buy them without\\r\\nsuspicion. He came here, meaning to work this very trick; he had\\r\\nthe links made right to the shape beforehand, and then he stole the\\r\\nstones and slipped them into their places. It\\'s a wonderfully clever\\r\\ntrick. Upon my soul, I almost admire the fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Charles is a business man himself, and can appreciate business\\r\\ncapacity in others.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow Colonel Clay came to know about that necklet, and to appropriate\\r\\ntwo of the stones, we only discovered much later. I will not here\\r\\nanticipate that disclosure. One thing at a time is a good rule in\\r\\nlife. For the moment he succeeded in baffling us altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, we followed him on to Paris, telegraphing beforehand to the\\r\\nBank of France to stop the notes. It was all in vain. They had been\\r\\ncashed within half an hour of my paying them. The curate and his\\r\\nwife, we found, quitted the H\\xc3\\xb4tel des Deux Mondes for parts unknown\\r\\nthat same afternoon. And, as usual with Colonel Clay, they vanished\\r\\ninto space, leaving no clue behind them. In other words, they\\r\\nchanged their disguise, no doubt, and reappeared somewhere else that\\r\\nnight in altered characters. At any rate, no such person as the\\r\\nReverend Richard Peploe Brabazon was ever afterwards heard of--and,\\r\\nfor the matter of that, no such village exists as Empingham,\\r\\nNorthumberland.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe communicated the matter to the Parisian police. They were _most_\\r\\nunsympathetic. \"It is no doubt Colonel Clay,\" said the official\\r\\nwhom we saw; \"but you seem to have little just ground of complaint\\r\\nagainst him. As far as I can see, messieurs, there is not much to\\r\\nchoose between you. You, Monsieur le Chevalier, desired to buy\\r\\ndiamonds at the price of paste. You, madame, feared you had bought\\r\\npaste at the price of diamonds. You, monsieur the secretary, tried\\r\\nto get the stones from an unsuspecting person for half their value.\\r\\nHe took you all in, that brave Colonel Caoutchouc--it was diamond\\r\\ncut diamond.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich was true, no doubt, but by no means consoling.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned to the Grand Hotel. Charles was fuming with indignation.\\r\\n\"This is really too much,\" he exclaimed. \"What an audacious rascal!\\r\\nBut he will never again take me in, my dear Sey. I only hope he\\'ll\\r\\ntry it on. I should love to catch him. I\\'d know him another time,\\r\\nI\\'m sure, in spite of his disguises. It\\'s absurd my being tricked\\r\\ntwice running like this. But never again while I live! Never again,\\r\\nI declare to you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Jamais de la vie!\" a courier in the hall close by murmured\\r\\nresponsive. We stood under the verandah of the Grand Hotel, in the\\r\\nbig glass courtyard. And I verily believe that courier was really\\r\\nColonel Clay himself in one of his disguises.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut perhaps we were beginning to suspect him everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE OLD MASTER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most South Africans, Sir Charles Vandrift is anything but\\r\\nsedentary. He hates sitting down. He must always \"trek.\" He cannot\\r\\nlive without moving about freely. Six weeks in Mayfair at a time is\\r\\nas much as he can stand. Then he must run away incontinently for\\r\\nrest and change to Scotland, Homburg, Monte Carlo, Biarritz. \"I\\r\\nwon\\'t be a limpet on the rock,\" he says. Thus it came to pass that\\r\\nin the early autumn we found ourselves stopping at the M\\xc3\\xa9tropole\\r\\nat Brighton. We were the accustomed nice little family party--Sir\\r\\nCharles and Amelia, myself and Isabel, with the suite as usual.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first Sunday morning after our arrival we strolled out,\\r\\nCharles and I--I regret to say during the hours allotted for Divine\\r\\nservice--on to the King\\'s Road, to get a whiff of fresh air, and a\\r\\nglimpse of the waves that were churning the Channel. The two ladies\\r\\n(with their bonnets) had gone to church; but Sir Charles had risen\\r\\nlate, fatigued from the week\\'s toil, while I myself was suffering\\r\\nfrom a matutinal headache, which I attributed to the close air in\\r\\nthe billiard-room overnight, combined, perhaps, with the insidious\\r\\neffect of a brand of soda-water to which I was little accustomed; I\\r\\nhad used it to dilute my evening whisky. We were to meet our wives\\r\\nafterwards at the church parade--an institution to which I believe\\r\\nboth Amelia and Isabel attach even greater importance than to the\\r\\nsermon which precedes it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat down on a glass seat. Charles gazed inquiringly up and down\\r\\nthe King\\'s Road, on the look-out for a boy with Sunday papers.\\r\\nAt last one passed. \"Observer,\" my brother-in-law called out\\r\\nlaconically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ain\\'t got none,\" the boy answered, brandishing his bundle in our\\r\\nfaces. \"\\'Ave a Referee or a Pink \\'Un?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles, however, is not a Refereader, while as to the Pink \\'Un, he\\r\\nconsiders it unsuitable for public perusal on Sunday morning. It may\\r\\nbe read indoors, but in the open air its blush betrays it. So he\\r\\nshook his head, and muttered, \"If you pass an Observer, send him on\\r\\nhere at once to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA polite stranger who sat close to us turned round with a pleasant\\r\\nsmile. \"Would you allow me to offer you one?\" he said, drawing a\\r\\ncopy from his pocket. \"I fancy I bought the last. There\\'s a run\\r\\non them to-day, you see. Important news this morning from the\\r\\nTransvaal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles raised his eyebrows, and accepted it, as I thought, just a\\r\\ntrifle grumpily. So, to remove the false impression his surliness\\r\\nmight produce on so benevolent a mind, I entered into conversation\\r\\nwith the polite stranger. He was a man of middle age, and medium\\r\\nheight, with a cultivated air, and a pair of gold pince-nez; his\\r\\neyes were sharp; his voice was refined; he dropped into talk before\\r\\nlong about distinguished people just then in Brighton. It was clear\\r\\nat once that he was hand in glove with many of the very best kind.\\r\\nWe compared notes as to Nice, Rome, Florence, Cairo. Our new\\r\\nacquaintance had scores of friends in common with us, it seemed;\\r\\nindeed, our circles so largely coincided, that I wondered we had\\r\\nnever happened till then to knock up against one another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Sir Charles Vandrift, the great African millionaire,\" he said\\r\\nat last, \"do you know anything of _him_? I\\'m told he\\'s at present\\r\\ndown here at the M\\xc3\\xa9tropole.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI waved my hand towards the person in question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_This_ is Sir Charles Vandrift,\" I answered, with proprietary pride;\\r\\n\"and _I_ am his brother-in-law, Mr. Seymour Wentworth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" the stranger answered, with a curious air of drawing\\r\\nin his horns. I wondered whether he had just been going to pretend\\r\\nhe knew Sir Charles, or whether perchance he was on the point of\\r\\nsaying something highly uncomplimentary, and was glad to have\\r\\nescaped it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time, however, Charles laid down the paper and chimed into\\r\\nour conversation. I could see at once from his mollified tone that\\r\\nthe news from the Transvaal was favourable to his operations in\\r\\nCloetedorp Golcondas. He was therefore in a friendly and affable\\r\\ntemper. His whole manner changed at once. He grew polite in return\\r\\nto the polite stranger. Besides, we knew the man moved in the best\\r\\nsociety; he had acquaintances whom Amelia was most anxious to secure\\r\\nfor her \"At Homes\" in Mayfair--young Faith, the novelist, and Sir\\r\\nRichard Montrose, the great Arctic traveller. As for the painters,\\r\\nit was clear that he was sworn friends with the whole lot of them.\\r\\nHe dined with Academicians, and gave weekly breakfasts to the\\r\\nmembers of the Institute. Now, Amelia is particularly desirous\\r\\nthat her salon should not be considered too exclusively financial\\r\\nand political in character: with a solid basis of M.P.\\'s and\\r\\nmillionaires, she loves a delicate under-current of literature,\\r\\nart, and the musical glasses. Our new acquaintance was extremely\\r\\ncommunicative: \"Knows his place in society, Sey,\" Sir Charles said\\r\\nto me afterwards, \"and is therefore not afraid of talking freely,\\r\\nas so many people are who have doubts about their position.\" We\\r\\nexchanged cards before we rose. Our new friend\\'s name turned out\\r\\nto be Dr. Edward Polperro.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In practice here?\" I inquired, though his garb belied it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, not medical,\" he answered. \"I am an LL.D. don\\'t you know. I\\r\\ninterest myself in art, and buy to some extent for the National\\r\\nGallery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very man for Amelia\\'s \"At Homes\"! Sir Charles snapped at him\\r\\ninstantly. \"I\\'ve brought my four-in-hand down here with me,\" he\\r\\nsaid, in his best friendly manner, \"and we think of tooling over\\r\\nto-morrow to Lewes. If you\\'d care to take a seat I\\'m sure Lady\\r\\nVandrift would be charmed to see you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re very kind,\" the Doctor said, \"on so casual an introduction.\\r\\nI\\'m sure I shall be delighted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We start from the M\\xc3\\xa9tropole at ten-thirty,\" Charles went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall be there. Good morning!\" And, with a satisfied smile, he\\r\\nrose and left us, nodding.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe returned to the lawn, to Amelia and Isabel. Our new friend passed\\r\\nus once or twice. Charles stopped him and introduced him. He was\\r\\nwalking with two ladies, most elegantly dressed in rather peculiar\\r\\nartistic dresses. Amelia was taken at first sight by his manner.\\r\\n\"One could see at a glance,\" she said, \"he was a person of culture\\r\\nand of real distinction. I wonder whether he could bring the P.R.A.\\r\\nto my Parliamentary \\'At Home\\' on Wednesday fortnight?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, at ten-thirty, we started on our drive. Our team has been\\r\\nconsidered the best in Sussex. Charles is an excellent, though\\r\\nsomewhat anxious--or, might I say better, somewhat careful?--whip.\\r\\nHe finds the management of two leaders and two wheelers fills his\\r\\nhands for the moment, both literally and figuratively, leaving very\\r\\nlittle time for general conversation. Lady Belleisle of Beacon\\r\\nbloomed beside him on the box (her bloom is perennial, and applied\\r\\nby her maid); Dr. Polperro occupied the seat just behind with myself\\r\\nand Amelia. The Doctor talked most of the time to Lady Vandrift: his\\r\\ndiscourse was of picture-galleries, which Amelia detests, but in\\r\\nwhich she thinks it incumbent upon her, as Sir Charles\\'s wife, to\\r\\naffect now and then a cultivated interest. Noblesse oblige; and the\\r\\nwalls of Castle Seldon, our place in Ross-shire, are almost covered\\r\\nnow with Leaders and with Orchardsons. This result was first arrived\\r\\nat by a singular accident. Sir Charles wanted a leader--for his\\r\\ncoach, you understand--and told an artistic friend so. The artistic\\r\\nfriend brought him a Leader next week with a capital L; and Sir\\r\\nCharles was so taken aback that he felt ashamed to confess the\\r\\nerror. So he was turned unawares into a patron of painting.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Polperro, in spite of his too pronouncedly artistic talk, proved\\r\\non closer view a most agreeable companion. He diversified his art\\r\\ncleverly with anecdotes and scandals; he told us exactly which\\r\\nfamous painters had married their cooks, and which had only married\\r\\ntheir models; and otherwise showed himself a most diverting talker.\\r\\nAmong other things, however, he happened to mention once that he\\r\\nhad recently discovered a genuine Rembrandt--a quite undoubted\\r\\nRembrandt, which had remained for years in the keeping of a\\r\\ncertain obscure Dutch family. It had always been allowed to be a\\r\\nmasterpiece of the painter, but it had seldom been seen for the\\r\\nlast half-century save by a few intimate acquaintances. It was a\\r\\nportrait of one Maria Vanrenen of Haarlem, and he had bought it\\r\\nof her descendants at Gouda, in Holland.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw Charles prick up his ears, though he took no open notice.\\r\\nThis Maria Vanrenen, as it happened, was a remote collateral\\r\\nancestress of the Vandrifts, before they emigrated to the Cape in\\r\\n1780; and the existence of the portrait, though not its whereabouts,\\r\\nwas well known in the family. Isabel had often mentioned it. If it\\r\\nwas to be had at anything like a reasonable price, it would be a\\r\\nsplendid thing for the boys (Sir Charles, I ought to say, has two\\r\\nsons at Eton) to possess an undoubted portrait of an ancestress\\r\\nby Rembrandt.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Polperro talked a good deal after that about this valuable find.\\r\\nHe had tried to sell it at first to the National Gallery; but\\r\\nthough the Directors admired the work immensely, and admitted its\\r\\ngenuineness, they regretted that the funds at their disposal this\\r\\nyear did not permit them to acquire so important a canvas at a\\r\\nproper figure. South Kensington again was too poor; but the Doctor\\r\\nwas in treaty at present with the Louvre and with Berlin. Still,\\r\\nit was a pity a fine work of art like that, once brought into the\\r\\ncountry, should be allowed to go out of it. Some patriotic patron\\r\\nof the fine arts ought to buy it for his own house, or else\\r\\nmunificently present it to the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the time Charles said nothing. But I could feel him cogitating.\\r\\nHe even looked behind him once, near a difficult corner (while the\\r\\nguard was actually engaged in tootling his horn to let passers-by\\r\\nknow that the coach was coming), and gave Amelia a warning glance\\r\\nto say nothing committing, which had at once the requisite effect\\r\\nof sealing her mouth for the moment. It is a very unusual thing\\r\\nfor Charles to look back while driving. I gathered from his doing\\r\\nso that he was inordinately anxious to possess this Rembrandt.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived at Lewes we put up our horses at the inn,\\r\\nand Charles ordered a lunch on his wonted scale of princely\\r\\nmagnificence. Meanwhile we wandered, two and two, about the town\\r\\nand castle. I annexed Lady Belleisle, who is at least amusing.\\r\\nCharles drew me aside before starting. \"Look here, Sey,\" he\\r\\nsaid, \"we must be _very_ careful. This man, Polperro, is a chance\\r\\nacquaintance. There\\'s nothing an astute rogue can take one in over\\r\\nmore easily than an Old Master. If the Rembrandt is genuine I\\r\\nought to have it; if it really represents Maria Vanrenen, it\\'s a\\r\\nduty I owe to the boys to buy it. But I\\'ve been done twice lately,\\r\\nand I won\\'t be done a third time. We must go to work cautiously.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are right,\" I answered. \"No more seers and curates!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If this man\\'s an impostor,\" Charles went on--\"and in spite of what\\r\\nhe says about the National Gallery and so forth, we know nothing of\\r\\nhim--the story he tells is just the sort of one such a fellow would\\r\\ntrump up in a moment to deceive me. He could easily learn who I\\r\\nwas--I\\'m a well-known figure; he knew I was in Brighton, and he\\r\\nmay have been sitting on that glass seat on Sunday on purpose to\\r\\nentrap me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He introduced your name,\" I said, \"and the moment he found out who\\r\\nI was he plunged into talk with me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" Charles continued. \"He may have learned about the portrait\\r\\nof Maria Vanrenen, which my grandmother always said was preserved\\r\\nat Gouda; and, indeed, I myself have often mentioned it, as you\\r\\ndoubtless remember. If so, what more natural, say, for a rogue than\\r\\nto begin talking about the portrait in that innocent way to Amelia?\\r\\nIf he wants a Rembrandt, I believe they can be turned out to order\\r\\nto any amount in Birmingham. The moral of all which is, it behoves\\r\\nus to be careful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Right you are,\" I answered; \"and I am keeping my eye upon him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe drove back by another road, overshadowed by beech-trees in\\r\\nautumnal gold. It was a delightful excursion. Dr. Polperro\\'s heart\\r\\nwas elated by lunch and the excellent dry Monopole. He talked\\r\\namazingly. I never heard a man with a greater or more varied flow\\r\\nof anecdote. He had been everywhere and knew all about everybody.\\r\\nAmelia booked him at once for her \"At Home\" on Wednesday week,\\r\\nand he promised to introduce her to several artistic and literary\\r\\ncelebrities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening, however, about half-past seven, Charles and I strolled\\r\\nout together on the King\\'s Road for a blow before dinner. We dine at\\r\\neight. The air was delicious. We passed a small new hotel, very\\r\\nsmart and exclusive, with a big bow window. There, in evening dress,\\r\\nlights burning and blind up, sat our friend, Dr. Polperro, with a\\r\\nlady facing him, young, graceful, and pretty. A bottle of champagne\\r\\nstood open before him. He was helping himself plentifully to\\r\\nhot-house grapes, and full of good humour. It was clear he and the\\r\\nlady were occupied in the intense enjoyment of some capital joke;\\r\\nfor they looked queerly at one another, and burst now and again\\r\\ninto merry peals of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI drew back. So did Sir Charles. One idea passed at once through\\r\\nboth our minds. I murmured, \"Colonel Clay!\" He answered, \"_and_\\r\\nMadame Picardet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were not in the least like the Reverend Richard and Mrs.\\r\\nBrabazon. But that clinched the matter. Nor did I see a sign of the\\r\\naquiline nose of the Mexican Seer. Still, I had learnt by then to\\r\\ndiscount appearances. If these were indeed the famous sharper and\\r\\nhis wife or accomplice, we must be very careful. We were forewarned\\r\\nthis time. Supposing he had the audacity to try a third trick of\\r\\nthe sort upon us we had him under our thumbs. Only, we must take\\r\\nsteps to prevent his dexterously slipping through our fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He can wriggle like an eel,\" said the Commissary at Nice. We both\\r\\nrecalled those words, and laid our plans deep to prevent the man\\'s\\r\\nwriggling away from us on this third occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you what it is, Sey,\" my brother-in-law said, with\\r\\nimpressive slowness. \"This time we must deliberately lay ourselves\\r\\nout to be swindled. We must propose of our own accord to buy the\\r\\npicture, making him guarantee it in writing as a genuine Rembrandt,\\r\\nand taking care to tie him down by most stringent conditions. But\\r\\nwe must seem at the same time to be unsuspicious and innocent as\\r\\nbabes; we must swallow whole whatever lies he tells us; pay his\\r\\nprice--nominally--by cheque for the portrait; and then, arrest him\\r\\nthe moment the bargain is complete, with the proofs of his guilt\\r\\nthen and there upon him. Of course, what he\\'ll try to do will be to\\r\\nvanish into thin air at once, as he did at Nice and Paris; but, this\\r\\ntime, we\\'ll have the police in waiting and everything ready. We\\'ll\\r\\navoid precipitancy, but we\\'ll avoid delay too. We must hold our\\r\\nhands off till he\\'s actually accepted and pocketed the money; and\\r\\nthen, we must nab him instantly, and walk him off to the local Bow\\r\\nStreet. That\\'s my plan of campaign. Meanwhile, we should appear\\r\\nall trustful innocence and confiding guilelessness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pursuance of this well-laid scheme, we called next day on Dr.\\r\\nPolperro at his hotel, and were introduced to his wife, a dainty\\r\\nlittle woman, in whom we affected not to recognise that arch Madame\\r\\nPicardet or that simple White Heather. The Doctor talked charmingly\\r\\n(as usual) about art--what a well-informed rascal he was, to be\\r\\nsure!--and Sir Charles expressed some interest in the supposed\\r\\nRembrandt. Our new friend was delighted; we could see by his\\r\\nwell-suppressed eagerness of tone that he knew us at once for\\r\\nprobable purchasers. He would run up to town next day, he said, and\\r\\nbring down the portrait. And in effect, when Charles and I took our\\r\\nwonted places in the Pullman next morning, on our way up to the\\r\\nhalf-yearly meeting of Cloetedorp Golcondas, there was our Doctor,\\r\\nleaning back in his arm-chair as if the car belonged to him. Charles\\r\\ngave me an expressive look. \"Does it in style,\" he whispered,\\r\\n\"doesn\\'t he? Takes it out of my five thousand; or discounts the\\r\\namount he means to chouse me of with his spurious Rembrandt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived in town, we went to work at once. We set a private detective\\r\\nfrom Marvillier\\'s to watch our friend; and from him we learned that\\r\\nthe so-called Doctor dropped in for a picture that day at a dealer\\'s\\r\\nin the West-end (I suppress the name, having a judicious fear of\\r\\nthe law of libel ever before my eyes), a dealer who was known to be\\r\\nmixed up before then in several shady or disreputable transactions.\\r\\nThough, to be sure, my experience has been that picture dealers\\r\\nare--picture dealers. Horses rank first in my mind as begetters and\\r\\nproducers of unscrupulous agents, but pictures run them a very good\\r\\nsecond. Anyhow, we found out that our distinguished art-critic\\r\\npicked up his Rembrandt at this dealer\\'s shop, and came down with\\r\\nit in his care the same night to Brighton.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order not to act precipitately, and so ruin our plans, we induced\\r\\nDr. Polperro (what a cleverly chosen name!) to bring the Rembrandt\\r\\nround to the M\\xc3\\xa9tropole for our inspection, and to leave it with us\\r\\nwhile we got the opinion of an expert from London.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expert came down, and gave us a full report upon the alleged\\r\\nOld Master. In his judgment, it was not a Rembrandt at all, but\\r\\na cunningly-painted and well-begrimed modern Dutch imitation.\\r\\nMoreover, he showed us by documentary evidence that the real\\r\\nportrait of Maria Vanrenen had, as a matter of fact, been brought\\r\\nto England five years before, and sold to Sir J. H. Tomlinson, the\\r\\nwell-known connoisseur, for eight thousand pounds. Dr. Polperro\\'s\\r\\npicture was, therefore, at best either a replica by Rembrandt; or\\r\\nelse, more probably, a copy by a pupil; or, most likely of all,\\r\\na mere modern forgery.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were thus well prepared to fasten our charge of criminal\\r\\nconspiracy upon the self-styled Doctor. But in order to make\\r\\nassurance still more certain, we threw out vague hints to him that\\r\\nthe portrait of Maria Vanrenen might really be elsewhere, and even\\r\\nsuggested in his hearing that it might not improbably have got into\\r\\nthe hands of that omnivorous collector, Sir J. H. Tomlinson. But\\r\\nthe vendor was proof against all such attempts to decry his goods.\\r\\nHe had the effrontery to brush away the documentary evidence, and to\\r\\ndeclare that Sir J. H. Tomlinson (one of the most learned and astute\\r\\npicture-buyers in England) had been smartly imposed upon by a needy\\r\\nDutch artist with a talent for forgery. The real Maria Vanrenen, he\\r\\ndeclared and swore, was the one he offered us. \"Success has turned\\r\\nthe man\\'s head,\" Charles said to me, well pleased. \"He thinks we\\r\\nwill swallow any obvious lie he chooses to palm off upon us. But the\\r\\nbucket has come once too often to the well. This time we checkmate\\r\\nhim.\" It was a mixed metaphor, I admit; but Sir Charles\\'s tropes\\r\\nare not always entirely superior to criticism.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we pretended to believe our man, and accepted his assurances.\\r\\nNext came the question of price. This was warmly debated, for form\\'s\\r\\nsake only. Sir J. H. Tomlinson had paid eight thousand for his\\r\\ngenuine Maria. The Doctor demanded ten thousand for his spurious\\r\\none. There was really no reason why we should higgle and dispute,\\r\\nfor Charles meant merely to give his cheque for the sum and then\\r\\narrest the fellow; but, still, we thought it best for the avoidance\\r\\nof suspicion to make a show of resistance; and we at last beat him\\r\\ndown to nine thousand guineas. For this amount he was to give us a\\r\\nwritten warranty that the work he sold us was a genuine Rembrandt,\\r\\nthat it represented Maria Vanrenen of Haarlem, and that he had\\r\\nbought it direct, without doubt or question, from that good lady\\'s\\r\\ndescendants at Gouda, in Holland.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was capitally done. We arranged the thing to perfection. We had a\\r\\nconstable in waiting in our rooms at the M\\xc3\\xa9tropole, and we settled\\r\\nthat Dr. Polperro was to call at the hotel at a certain fixed hour\\r\\nto sign the warranty and receive his money. A regular agreement on\\r\\nsound stamped paper was drawn out between us. At the appointed time\\r\\nthe \"party of the first part\" came, having already given us over\\r\\npossession of the portrait. Charles drew a cheque for the amount\\r\\nagreed upon, and signed it. Then he handed it to the Doctor.\\r\\nPolperro just clutched at it. Meanwhile, I took up my post by\\r\\nthe door, while two men in plain clothes, detectives from the\\r\\npolice-station, stood as men-servants and watched the windows. We\\r\\nfeared lest the impostor, once he had got the cheque, should dodge\\r\\nus somehow, as he had already done at Nice and in Paris. The moment\\r\\nhe had pocketed his money with a smile of triumph, I advanced to him\\r\\nrapidly. I had in my possession a pair of handcuffs. Before he knew\\r\\nwhat was happening, I had slipped them on his wrists and secured\\r\\nthem dexterously, while the constable stepped forward. \"We have got\\r\\nyou this time!\" I cried. \"We know who you are, Dr. Polperro. You\\r\\nare--Colonel Clay, alias Se\\xc3\\xb1or Antonio Herrera, alias the Reverend\\r\\nRichard Peploe Brabazon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI never saw any man so astonished in my life! He was utterly\\r\\nflabbergasted. Charles thought he must have expected to get clear\\r\\naway at once, and that this prompt action on our part had taken\\r\\nthe fellow so much by surprise as to simply unman him. He gazed\\r\\nabout him as if he hardly realised what was happening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are these two raving maniacs?\" he asked at last, \"or what do they\\r\\nmean by this nonsensical gibberish about Antonio Herrera?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constable laid his hand on the prisoner\\'s shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s all right, my man,\" he said. \"We\\'ve got warrants out against\\r\\nyou. I arrest you, Edward Polperro, alias the Reverend Richard\\r\\nPeploe Brabazon, on a charge of obtaining money under false\\r\\npretences from Sir Charles Vandrift, K.C.M.G., M.P., on his sworn\\r\\ninformation, now here subscribed to.\" For Charles had had the\\r\\nthing drawn out in readiness beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur prisoner drew himself up. \"Look here, officer,\" he said, in an\\r\\noffended tone, \"there\\'s some mistake here in this matter. I have\\r\\nnever given an alias at any time in my life. How do you know this\\r\\nis really Sir Charles Vandrift? It may be a case of bullying\\r\\npersonation. My belief is, though, they\\'re a pair of escaped\\r\\nlunatics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We\\'ll see about that to-morrow,\" the constable said, collaring him.\\r\\n\"At present you\\'ve got to go off with me quietly to the station,\\r\\nwhere these gentlemen will enter up the charge against you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey carried him off, protesting. Charles and I signed the\\r\\ncharge-sheet; and the officer locked him up to await his examination\\r\\nnext day before the magistrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were half afraid even now the fellow would manage somehow to\\r\\nget out on bail and give us the slip in spite of everything;\\r\\nand, indeed, he protested in the most violent manner against the\\r\\ntreatment to which we were subjecting \"a gentleman in his position.\"\\r\\nBut Charles took care to tell the police it was all right; that he\\r\\nwas a dangerous and peculiarly slippery criminal, and that on no\\r\\naccount must they let him go on any pretext whatever, till he had\\r\\nbeen properly examined before the magistrates.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe learned at the hotel that night, curiously enough, that there\\r\\nreally _was_ a Dr. Polperro, a distinguished art critic, whose\\r\\nname, we didn\\'t doubt, our impostor had been assuming.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, when we reached the court, an inspector met us with a\\r\\nvery long face. \"Look here, gentlemen,\" he said, \"I\\'m afraid you\\'ve\\r\\ncommitted a very serious blunder. You\\'ve made a precious bad mess of\\r\\nit. You\\'ve got yourselves into a scrape; and, what\\'s worse, you\\'ve\\r\\ngot us into one also. You were a deal too smart with your sworn\\r\\ninformation. We\\'ve made inquiries about this gentleman, and we find\\r\\nthe account he gives of himself is perfectly correct. His name _is_\\r\\nPolperro; he\\'s a well-known art critic and collector of pictures,\\r\\nemployed abroad by the National Gallery. He was formerly an official\\r\\nin the South Kensington Museum, and he\\'s a C.B. and LL.D., very\\r\\nhighly respected. You\\'ve made a sad mistake, that\\'s where it is; and\\r\\nyou\\'ll probably have to answer a charge of false imprisonment, in\\r\\nwhich I\\'m afraid you have also involved our own department.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles gasped with horror. \"You haven\\'t let him out,\" he cried, \"on\\r\\nthose absurd representations? You haven\\'t let him slip through your\\r\\nhands as you did that murderer fellow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let him slip through our hands?\" the inspector cried. \"I only wish\\r\\nhe would. There\\'s no chance of that, unfortunately. He\\'s in the\\r\\ncourt there, this moment, breathing out fire and slaughter against\\r\\nyou both; and we\\'re here to protect you if he should happen to fall\\r\\nupon you. He\\'s been locked up all night on your mistaken affidavits,\\r\\nand, naturally enough, he\\'s mad with anger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you haven\\'t let him go, I\\'m satisfied,\" Charles answered.\\r\\n\"He\\'s a fox for cunning. Where is he? Let me see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went into the court. There we saw our prisoner conversing\\r\\namicably, in the most excited way, with the magistrate (who, it\\r\\nseems, was a personal friend of his); and Charles at once went\\r\\nup and spoke to them. Dr. Polperro turned round and glared at him\\r\\nthrough his pince-nez.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The only possible explanation of this person\\'s extraordinary and\\r\\nincredible conduct,\" he said, \"is, that he must be mad--and his\\r\\nsecretary equally so. He made my acquaintance, unasked, on a glass\\r\\nseat on the King\\'s Road; invited me to go on his coach to Lewes;\\r\\nvolunteered to buy a valuable picture of me; and then, at the\\r\\nlast moment, unaccountably gave me in charge on this silly and\\r\\npreposterous trumped-up accusation. I demand a summons for false\\r\\nimprisonment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly it began to dawn upon us that the tables were turned. By\\r\\ndegrees it came out that we had made a mistake. Dr. Polperro was\\r\\nreally the person he represented himself to be, and had been always.\\r\\nHis picture, we found out, was the real Maria Vanrenen, and a\\r\\ngenuine Rembrandt, which he had merely deposited for cleaning and\\r\\nrestoring at the suspicious dealer\\'s. Sir J. H. Tomlinson had been\\r\\nimposed upon and cheated by a cunning Dutchman; _his_ picture, though\\r\\nalso an undoubted Rembrandt, was _not_ the Maria, and was an inferior\\r\\nspecimen in bad preservation. The authority we had consulted turned\\r\\nout to be an ignorant, self-sufficient quack. The Maria, moreover,\\r\\nwas valued by other experts at no more than five or six thousand\\r\\nguineas. Charles wanted to cry off his bargain, but Dr. Polperro\\r\\nnaturally wouldn\\'t hear of it. The agreement was a legally binding\\r\\ninstrument, and what passed in Charles\\'s mind at the moment had\\r\\nnothing to do with the written contract. Our adversary only\\r\\nconsented to forego the action for false imprisonment on condition\\r\\nthat Charles inserted a printed apology in the Times, and paid him\\r\\nfive hundred pounds compensation for damage to character. So that\\r\\nwas the end of our well-planned attempt to arrest the swindler.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot quite the end, however; for, of course, after this, the whole\\r\\naffair got by degrees into the papers. Dr. Polperro, who was a\\r\\nfamiliar person in literary and artistic society, as it turned out,\\r\\nbrought an action against the so-called expert who had declared\\r\\nagainst the genuineness of his alleged Rembrandt, and convicted him\\r\\nof the grossest ignorance and misstatement. Then paragraphs got\\r\\nabout. The World showed us up in a sarcastic article; and Truth,\\r\\nwhich has always been terribly severe upon Sir Charles and all the\\r\\nother South Africans, had a pungent set of verses on \"High Art in\\r\\nKimberley.\" By this means, as we suppose, the affair became known\\r\\nto Colonel Clay himself; for a week or two later my brother-in-law\\r\\nreceived a cheerful little note on scented paper from our persistent\\r\\nsharper. It was couched in these terms:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, you innocent infant!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bless your ingenuous little heart! And did it believe, then, it\\r\\nhad positively caught the redoubtable colonel? And had it ready a\\r\\nnice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail? And is it true its\\r\\nrespected name is Sir Simple Simon? How heartily we have laughed,\\r\\nWhite Heather and I, at your neat little ruses! It would pay you,\\r\\nby the way, to take White Heather into your house for six months\\r\\nto instruct you in the agreeable sport of amateur detectives. Your\\r\\ncharming naivete quite moves our envy. So you actually imagined a\\r\\nman of my brains would condescend to anything so flat and stale as\\r\\nthe silly and threadbare Old Master deception! And this in the\\r\\nso-called nineteenth century! O sancta simplicitas! When again\\r\\nshall such infantile transparency be mine? When, ah, when? But never\\r\\nmind, dear friend. Though you didn\\'t catch me, we shall meet before\\r\\nlong at some delightful Philippi.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yours, with the profoundest respect and gratitude,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"ANTONIO HERRERA,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Otherwise RICHARD PEPLOE BRABAZON.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles laid down the letter with a deep-drawn sigh. \"Sey, my boy,\"\\r\\nhe mused aloud, \"no fortune on earth--not even mine--can go on\\r\\nstanding it. These perpetual drains begin really to terrify me. I\\r\\nforesee the end. I shall die in a workhouse. What with the money he\\r\\nrobs me of when he _is_ Colonel Clay, and the money I waste upon him\\r\\nwhen he _isn\\'t_ Colonel Clay, the man is beginning to tell upon my\\r\\nnervous system. I shall withdraw altogether from this worrying life.\\r\\nI shall retire from a scheming and polluted world to some untainted\\r\\nspot in the fresh, pure mountains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You _must_ need rest and change,\" I said, \"when you talk like that.\\r\\nLet us try the Tyrol.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE TYROLEAN CASTLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went to Meran. The place was practically decided for us by\\r\\nAmelia\\'s French maid, who really acts on such occasions as our\\r\\nguide and courier.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is _such_ a clever girl, is Amelia\\'s French maid. Whenever we\\r\\nare going anywhere, Amelia generally asks (and accepts) her advice\\r\\nas to choice of hotels and furnished villas. C\\xc3\\xa9sarine has been all\\r\\nover the Continent in her time; and, being Alsatian by birth, she of\\r\\ncourse speaks German as well as she speaks French, while her long\\r\\nresidence with Amelia has made her at last almost equally at home\\r\\nin our native English. She is a treasure, that girl; so neat and\\r\\ndexterous, and not above dabbling in anything on earth she may be\\r\\nasked to turn her hand to. She walks the world with a needle-case\\r\\nin one hand and an etna in the other. She can cook an omelette on\\r\\noccasion, or drive a Norwegian cariole; she can sew, and knit, and\\r\\nmake dresses, and cure a cold, and do anything else on earth you ask\\r\\nher. Her salads are the most savoury I ever tasted; while as for her\\r\\ncoffee (which she prepares for us in the train on long journeys),\\r\\nthere isn\\'t a chef de cuisine at a West-end club to be named in the\\r\\nsame day with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when Amelia said, in her imperious way, \"C\\xc3\\xa9sarine, we want to go\\r\\nto the Tyrol--now--at once--in mid-October; where do you advise us\\r\\nto put up?\"--C\\xc3\\xa9sarine answered, like a shot, \"The Erzherzog Johann,\\r\\nof course, at Meran, for the autumn, madame.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is he ... an archduke?\" Amelia asked, a little staggered at such\\r\\napparent familiarity with Imperial personages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ma foi! no, madame. He is an hotel--as you would say in England,\\r\\nthe \\'Victoria\\' or the \\'Prince of Wales\\'s\\'--the most comfortable\\r\\nhotel in all South Tyrol; and at this time of year, naturally, you\\r\\nmust go beyond the Alps; it begins already to be cold at Innsbruck.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo to Meran we went; and a prettier or more picturesque place, I\\r\\nconfess, I have seldom set eyes on. A rushing torrent; high hills\\r\\nand mountain peaks; terraced vineyard slopes; old walls and towers;\\r\\nquaint, arcaded streets; a craggy waterfall; a promenade after\\r\\nthe fashion of a German Spa; and when you lift your eyes from the\\r\\nground, jagged summits of Dolomites: it was a combination such as\\r\\nI had never before beheld; a Rhine town plumped down among green\\r\\nAlpine heights, and threaded by the cool colonnades of Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI approved C\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s choice; and I was particularly glad she\\r\\nhad pronounced for an hotel, where all is plain sailing, instead\\r\\nof advising a furnished villa, the arrangements for which would\\r\\nnaturally have fallen in large part upon the shoulders of the\\r\\nwretched secretary. As in any case I have to do three hours\\' work\\r\\na day, I feel that such additions to my normal burden may well\\r\\nbe spared me. I tipped C\\xc3\\xa9sarine half a sovereign, in fact, for\\r\\nher judicious choice. C\\xc3\\xa9sarine glanced at it on her palm in her\\r\\nmysterious, curious, half-smiling way, and pocketed it at once with\\r\\na \"Merci, monsieur!\" that had a touch of contempt in it. I always\\r\\nfancy C\\xc3\\xa9sarine has large ideas of her own on the subject of tipping,\\r\\nand thinks very small beer of the modest sums a mere secretary can\\r\\nalone afford to bestow upon her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great peculiarity of Meran is the number of schlosses (I believe\\r\\nmy plural is strictly irregular, but very convenient to English\\r\\nears) which you can see in every direction from its outskirts. A\\r\\nstatistical eye, it is supposed, can count no fewer than forty of\\r\\nthese picturesque, ramshackled old castles from a point on the\\r\\nK\\xc3\\xbcchelberg. For myself, I hate statistics (except as an element in\\r\\nfinancial prospectuses), and I really don\\'t know how many ruinous\\r\\npiles Isabel and Amelia counted under C\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s guidance; but I\\r\\nremember that most of them were quaint and beautiful, and that their\\r\\nvariety of architecture seemed positively bewildering. One would be\\r\\nsquare, with funny little turrets stuck out at each angle; while\\r\\nanother would rejoice in a big round keep, and spread on either side\\r\\nlong, ivy-clad walls and delightful bastions. Charles was immensely\\r\\ntaken with them. He loves the picturesque, and has a poet hidden\\r\\nin that financial soul of his. (Very effectually hidden, though, I\\r\\nam ready to grant you.) From the moment he came he felt at once\\r\\nhe would love to possess a castle of his own among these romantic\\r\\nmountains. \"Seldon!\" he exclaimed contemptuously. \"They call Seldon\\r\\na castle! But you and I know very well, Sey, it was built in 1860,\\r\\nwith sham antique stones, for Macpherson of Seldon, at market rates,\\r\\nby Cubitt and Co., worshipful contractors of London. Macpherson\\r\\ncharged me for that sham antiquity a preposterous price, at\\r\\nwhich one ought to procure a real ancestral mansion. Now, _these_\\r\\ncastles are real. They are hoary with antiquity. Schloss Tyrol is\\r\\nRomanesque--tenth or eleventh century.\" (He had been reading it up\\r\\nin Baedeker.) \"That\\'s the sort of place for _me_!--tenth or eleventh\\r\\ncentury. I could live here, remote from stocks and shares, for ever;\\r\\nand in these sequestered glens, recollect, Sey, my boy, there are\\r\\nno Colonel Clays, and no arch Madame Picardets!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a matter of fact, he could have lived there six weeks, and then\\r\\ntired for Park Lane, Monte Carlo, Brighton.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Amelia, strange to say, she was equally taken with this new\\r\\nfad of Charles\\'s. As a rule she hates everywhere on earth save\\r\\nLondon, except during the time when no respectable person can be\\r\\nseen in town, and when modest blinds shade the scandalised face of\\r\\nMayfair and Belgravia. She bores herself to death even at Seldon\\r\\nCastle, Ross-shire, and yawns all day long in Paris or Vienna. She\\r\\nis a confirmed Cockney. Yet, for some occult reason, my amiable\\r\\nsister-in-law fell in love with South Tyrol. She wanted to vegetate\\r\\nin that lush vegetation. The grapes were being picked; pumpkins hung\\r\\nover the walls; Virginia creeper draped the quaint gray schlosses\\r\\nwith crimson cloaks; and everything was as beautiful as a dream of\\r\\nBurne-Jones\\'s. (I know I am quite right in mentioning Burne-Jones,\\r\\nespecially in connection with Romanesque architecture, because I\\r\\nheard him highly praised on that very ground by our friend and\\r\\nenemy, Dr. Edward Polperro.) So perhaps it was excusable that\\r\\nAmelia should fall in love with it all, under the circumstances;\\r\\nbesides, she is largely influenced by what C\\xc3\\xa9sarine says, and\\r\\nC\\xc3\\xa9sarine declares there is no climate in Europe like Meran in\\r\\nwinter. I do not agree with her. The sun sets behind the hills at\\r\\nthree in the afternoon, and a nasty warm wind blows moist over\\r\\nthe snow in January and February.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Amelia set C\\xc3\\xa9sarine to inquire of the people at the hotel\\r\\nabout the market price of tumbledown ruins, and the number of such\\r\\neligible family mausoleums just then for sale in the immediate\\r\\nneighbourhood. C\\xc3\\xa9sarine returned with a full, true, and particular\\r\\nlist, adorned with flowers of rhetoric which would have delighted\\r\\nthe soul of good old John Robins. They were all picturesque, all\\r\\nRomanesque, all richly ivy-clad, all commodious, all historical,\\r\\nand all the property of high well-born Grafs and very honourable\\r\\nFreiherrs. Most of them had been the scene of celebrated tournaments;\\r\\nseveral of them had witnessed the gorgeous marriages of Holy Roman\\r\\nEmperors; and every one of them was provided with some choice and\\r\\nselected first-class murders. Ghosts could be arranged for or not,\\r\\nas desired; and armorial bearings could be thrown in with the moat\\r\\nfor a moderate extra remuneration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two we liked best of all these tempting piles were Schloss\\r\\nPlanta and Schloss Lebenstein. We drove past both, and even I\\r\\nmyself, I confess, was distinctly taken with them. (Besides, when\\r\\na big purchase like this is on the stocks, a poor beggar of a\\r\\nsecretary has always a chance of exerting his influence and earning\\r\\nfor himself some modest commission.) Schloss Planta was the most\\r\\nstriking externally, I should say, with its Rhine-like towers, and\\r\\nits great gnarled ivy-stems, that looked as if they antedated the\\r\\nHouse of Hapsburg; but Lebenstein was said to be better preserved\\r\\nwithin, and more fitted in every way for modern occupation. Its\\r\\nstaircase has been photographed by 7000 amateurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got tickets to view. The invaluable C\\xc3\\xa9sarine procured them for\\r\\nus. Armed with these, we drove off one fine afternoon, meaning to\\r\\ngo to Planta, by C\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s recommendation. Half-way there, however,\\r\\nwe changed our minds, as it was such a lovely day, and went on up\\r\\nthe long, slow hill to Lebenstein. I must say the drive through the\\r\\ngrounds was simply charming. The castle stands perched (say rather\\r\\npoised, like St. Michael the archangel in Italian pictures) on a\\r\\nsolitary stack or crag of rock, looking down on every side upon\\r\\nits own rich vineyards. Chestnuts line the glens; the valley of\\r\\nthe Etsch spreads below like a picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vineyards alone make a splendid estate, by the way; they produce\\r\\na delicious red wine, which is exported to Bordeaux, and there\\r\\nbottled and sold as a vintage claret under the name of Chateau\\r\\nMonnivet. Charles revelled in the idea of growing his own wines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here we could sit,\" he cried to Amelia, \"in the most literal sense,\\r\\nunder our own vine and fig-tree. Delicious retirement! For my part,\\r\\nI\\'m sick and tired of the hubbub of Threadneedle Street.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe knocked at the door--for there was really no bell, but a\\r\\nponderous, old-fashioned, wrought-iron knocker. So deliciously\\r\\nmedi\\xc3\\xa6val! The late Graf von Lebenstein had recently died, we\\r\\nknew; and his son, the present Count, a young man of means, having\\r\\ninherited from his mother\\'s family a still more ancient and\\r\\nsplendid schloss in the Salzburg district, desired to sell this\\r\\noutlying estate in order to afford himself a yacht, after the manner\\r\\nthat is now becoming increasingly fashionable with the noblemen and\\r\\ngentlemen in Germany and Austria.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door was opened for us by a high well-born menial, attired in\\r\\na very ancient and honourable livery. Nice antique hall; suits of\\r\\nancestral armour, trophies of Tyrolese hunters, coats of arms of\\r\\nancient counts--the very thing to take Amelia\\'s aristocratic and\\r\\nromantic fancy. The whole to be sold exactly as it stood; ancestors\\r\\nto be included at a valuation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went through the reception-rooms. They were lofty, charming, and\\r\\nwith glorious views, all the more glorious for being framed by those\\r\\ngraceful Romanesque windows, with their slender pillars and quaint,\\r\\nround-topped arches. Sir Charles had made his mind up. \"I must and\\r\\nwill have it!\" he cried. \"This is the place for me. Seldon! Pah,\\r\\nSeldon is a modern abomination.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCould we see the high well-born Count? The liveried servant\\r\\n(somewhat haughtily) would inquire of his Serenity. Sir Charles\\r\\nsent up his card, and also Lady Vandrift\\'s. These foreigners know\\r\\ntitle spells money in England.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was right in his surmise. Two minutes later the Count entered\\r\\nwith our cards in his hands. A good-looking young man, with the\\r\\ncharacteristic Tyrolese long black moustache, dressed in a\\r\\ngentlemanly variant on the costume of the country. His air was a\\r\\njager\\'s; the usual blackcock\\'s plume stuck jauntily in the side of\\r\\nthe conical hat (which he held in his hand), after the universal\\r\\nAustrian fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe waved us to seats. We sat down. He spoke to us in French; his\\r\\nEnglish, he remarked, with a pleasant smile, being a n\\xc3\\xa9gligeable\\r\\nquantity. We might speak it, he went on; he could understand pretty\\r\\nwell; but he preferred to answer, if we would allow him, in French\\r\\nor German.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"French,\" Charles replied, and the negotiation continued thenceforth\\r\\nin that language. It is the only one, save English and his ancestral\\r\\nDutch, with which my brother-in-law possesses even a nodding\\r\\nacquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe praised the beautiful scene. The Count\\'s face lighted up with\\r\\npatriotic pride. Yes; it was beautiful, beautiful, his own green\\r\\nTyrol. He was proud of it and attached to it. But he could endure\\r\\nto sell this place, the home of his fathers, because he had a finer\\r\\nin the Salzkammergut, and a pied-\\xc3\\xa0-terre near Innsbruck. For Tyrol\\r\\nlacked just one joy--the sea. He was a passionate yachtsman. For\\r\\nthat he had resolved to sell this estate; after all, three country\\r\\nhouses, a ship, and a mansion in Vienna, are more than one man can\\r\\ncomfortably inhabit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" Charles answered. \"If I can come to terms with you about\\r\\nthis charming estate I shall sell my own castle in the Scotch\\r\\nHighlands.\" And he tried to look like a proud Scotch chief who\\r\\nharangues his clansmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they got to business. The Count was a delightful man to do\\r\\nbusiness with. His manners were perfect. While we were talking to\\r\\nhim, a surly person, a steward or bailiff, or something of the sort,\\r\\ncame into the room unexpectedly and addressed him in German, which\\r\\nnone of us understand. We were impressed by the singular urbanity\\r\\nand benignity of the nobleman\\'s demeanour towards this sullen\\r\\ndependant. He evidently explained to the fellow what sort of\\r\\npeople we were, and remonstrated with him in a very gentle way for\\r\\ninterrupting us. The steward understood, and clearly regretted his\\r\\ninsolent air; for after a few sentences he went out, and as he did\\r\\nso he bowed and made protestations of polite regard in his own\\r\\nlanguage. The Count turned to us and smiled. \"Our people,\" he said,\\r\\n\"are like your own Scotch peasants--kind-hearted, picturesque, free,\\r\\nmusical, poetic, but wanting, h\\xc3\\xa9las, in polish to strangers.\" He\\r\\nwas certainly an exception, if he described them aright; for he made\\r\\nus feel at home from the moment we entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe named his price in frank terms. His lawyers at Meran held the\\r\\nneedful documents, and would arrange the negotiations in detail with\\r\\nus. It was a stiff sum, I must say--an extremely stiff sum; but no\\r\\ndoubt he was charging us a fancy price for a fancy castle. \"He will\\r\\ncome down in time,\" Charles said. \"The sum first named in all these\\r\\ntransactions is invariably a feeler. They know I\\'m a millionaire;\\r\\nand people always imagine millionaires are positively made of\\r\\nmoney.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI may add that people always imagine it must be easier to squeeze\\r\\nmoney out of millionaires than out of other people--which is the\\r\\nreverse of the truth, or how could they ever have amassed their\\r\\nmillions? Instead of oozing gold as a tree oozes gum, they mop it\\r\\nup like blotting-paper, and seldom give it out again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe drove back from this first interview none the less very well\\r\\nsatisfied. The price was too high; but preliminaries were arranged,\\r\\nand for the rest, the Count desired us to discuss all details with\\r\\nhis lawyers in the chief street, Unter den Lauben. We inquired about\\r\\nthese lawyers, and found they were most respectable and respected\\r\\nmen; they had done the family business on either side for seven\\r\\ngenerations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey showed us plans and title-deeds. Everything quite en r\\xc3\\xa9gle.\\r\\nTill we came to the price there was no hitch of any sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to price, however, the lawyers were obdurate. They stuck out for\\r\\nthe Count\\'s first sum to the uttermost florin. It was a very big\\r\\nestimate. We talked and shilly-shallied till Sir Charles grew angry.\\r\\nHe lost his temper at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They know I\\'m a millionaire, Sey,\" he said, \"and they\\'re playing\\r\\nthe old game of trying to diddle me. But I won\\'t be diddled. Except\\r\\nColonel Clay, no man has ever yet succeeded in bleeding me. And\\r\\nshall I let myself be bled as if I were a chamois among these\\r\\ninnocent mountains? Perish the thought!\" Then he reflected a little\\r\\nin silence. \"Sey,\" he mused on, at last, \"the question is, _are_\\r\\nthey innocent? Do you know, I begin to believe there is no such\\r\\nthing left as pristine innocence anywhere. This Tyrolese Count knows\\r\\nthe value of a pound as distinctly as if he hung out in Capel Court\\r\\nor Kimberley.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThings dragged on in this way, inconclusively, for a week or two.\\r\\n_We_ bid down; the lawyers stuck to it. Sir Charles grew half sick\\r\\nof the whole silly business. For my own part, I felt sure if the\\r\\nhigh well-born Count didn\\'t quicken his pace, my respected relative\\r\\nwould shortly have had enough of the Tyrol altogether, and be proof\\r\\nagainst the most lovely of crag-crowning castles. But the Count\\r\\ndidn\\'t see it. He came to call on us at our hotel--a rare honour for\\r\\na stranger with these haughty and exclusive Tyrolese nobles--and\\r\\neven entered unannounced in the most friendly manner. But when it\\r\\ncame to L. s. d., he was absolute adamant. Not one kreutzer would\\r\\nhe abate from his original proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You misunderstand,\" he said, with pride. \"We Tyrolese gentlemen are\\r\\nnot shopkeepers or merchants. We do not higgle. If we say a thing we\\r\\nstick to it. Were you an Austrian, I should feel insulted by your\\r\\nill-advised attempt to beat down my price. But as you belong to a\\r\\ngreat commercial nation--\" he broke off with a snort and shrugged\\r\\nhis shoulders compassionately.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe saw him several times driving in and out of the schloss, and\\r\\nevery time he waved his hand at us gracefully. But when we tried to\\r\\nbargain, it was always the same thing: he retired behind the shelter\\r\\nof his Tyrolese nobility. We might take it or leave it. \\'Twas still\\r\\nSchloss Lebenstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lawyers were as bad. We tried all we knew, and got no forrarder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last Charles gave up the attempt in disgust. He was tiring, as I\\r\\nexpected. \"It\\'s the prettiest place I ever saw in my life,\" he said;\\r\\n\"but, hang it all, Sey, I _won\\'t_ be imposed upon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he made up his mind, it being now December, to return to London.\\r\\nWe met the Count next day, and stopped his carriage, and told him\\r\\nso. Charles thought this would have the immediate effect of bringing\\r\\nthe man to reason. But he only lifted his hat, with the blackcock\\'s\\r\\nfeather, and smiled a bland smile. \"The Archduke Karl is inquiring\\r\\nabout it,\" he answered, and drove on without parley.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles used some strong words, which I will not transcribe (I am a\\r\\nfamily man), and returned to England.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next two months we heard little from Amelia save her regret\\r\\nthat the Count wouldn\\'t sell us Schloss Lebenstein. Its pinnacles\\r\\nhad fairly pierced her heart. Strange to say, she was absolutely\\r\\ninfatuated about the castle. She rather wanted the place while\\r\\nshe was there, and thought she could get it; now she thought\\r\\nshe couldn\\'t, her soul (if she has one) was wildly set upon it.\\r\\nMoreover, C\\xc3\\xa9sarine further inflamed her desire by gently hinting\\r\\na fact which she had picked up at the courier\\'s table d\\'h\\xc3\\xb4te at\\r\\nthe hotel--that the Count had been far from anxious to sell his\\r\\nancestral and historical estate to a South African diamond king.\\r\\nHe thought the honour of the family demanded, at least, that he\\r\\nshould secure a wealthy buyer of good ancient lineage.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning in February, however, Amelia returned from the Row all\\r\\nsmiles and tremors. (She had been ordered horse-exercise to correct\\r\\nthe increasing excessiveness of her figure.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who do you think I saw riding in the Park?\" she inquired. \"Why,\\r\\nthe Count of Lebenstein.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" Charles exclaimed, incredulous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" Amelia answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Must be mistaken,\" Charles cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Amelia stuck to it. More than that, she sent out emissaries to\\r\\ninquire diligently from the London lawyers, whose name had been\\r\\nmentioned to us by the ancestral firm in Unter den Lauben as\\r\\ntheir English agents, as to the whereabouts of our friend; and\\r\\nher emissaries learned in effect that the Count was in town and\\r\\nstopping at Morley\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see through it,\" Charles exclaimed. \"He finds he\\'s made a\\r\\nmistake; and now he\\'s come over here to reopen negotiations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was all for waiting prudently till the Count made the first move.\\r\\n\"Don\\'t let him see your eagerness,\" I said. But Amelia\\'s ardour\\r\\ncould not now be restrained. She insisted that Charles should\\r\\ncall on the Graf as a mere return of his politeness in the Tyrol.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was as charming as ever. He talked to us with delight about the\\r\\nquaintness of London. He would be ravished to dine next evening with\\r\\nSir Charles. He desired his respectful salutations meanwhile to\\r\\nMiladi Vandrift and Madame Ventvorth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dined with us, almost en famille. Amelia\\'s cook did wonders. In\\r\\nthe billiard-room, about midnight, Charles reopened the subject.\\r\\nThe Count was really touched. It pleased him that still, amid the\\r\\ndistractions of the City of Five Million Souls, we should remember\\r\\nwith affection his beloved Lebenstein.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come to my lawyers,\" he said, \"to-morrow, and I will talk it all\\r\\nover with you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went--a most respectable firm in Southampton Row; old family\\r\\nsolicitors. They had done business for years for the late Count, who\\r\\nhad inherited from his grandmother estates in Ireland; and they were\\r\\nglad to be honoured with the confidence of his successor. Glad, too,\\r\\nto make the acquaintance of a prince of finance like Sir Charles\\r\\nVandrift. Anxious (rubbing their hands) to arrange matters\\r\\nsatisfactorily all round for everybody. (Two capital families with\\r\\nwhich to be mixed up, you see.)\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles named a price, and referred them to his solicitors.\\r\\nThe Count named a higher, but still a little come-down, and left\\r\\nthe matter to be settled between the lawyers. He was a soldier and\\r\\na gentleman, he said, with a Tyrolese toss of his high-born head;\\r\\nhe would abandon details to men of business.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was really anxious to oblige Amelia, I met the Count\\r\\naccidentally next day on the steps of Morley\\'s. (Accidentally,\\r\\nthat is to say, so far as he was concerned, though I had been\\r\\nhanging about in Trafalgar Square for half an hour to see him.)\\r\\nI explained, in guarded terms, that I had a great deal of influence\\r\\nin my way with Sir Charles; and that a word from me-- I broke\\r\\noff. He stared at me blankly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Commission?\" he inquired, at last, with a queer little smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, not exactly commission,\" I answered, wincing. \"Still, a\\r\\nfriendly word, you know. One good turn deserves another.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at me from head to foot with a curious scrutiny. For one\\r\\nmoment I feared the Tyrolese nobleman in him was going to raise its\\r\\nfoot and take active measures. But the next, I saw that Sir Charles\\r\\nwas right after all, and that pristine innocence has removed from\\r\\nthis planet to other quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe named his lowest price. \"M. Ventvorth,\" he said, \"I am a Tyrolese\\r\\nseigneur; I do not dabble, myself, in commissions and percentages.\\r\\nBut if your influence with Sir Charles--we understand each other, do\\r\\nwe not?--as between gentlemen--a little friendly present--no money,\\r\\nof course--but the equivalent of say 5 per cent in jewellery, on\\r\\nwhatever sum above his bid to-day you induce him to\\r\\noffer--eh?--c\\'est convenu?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ten per cent is more usual,\" I murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was the Austrian hussar again. \"Five, monsieur--or nothing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI bowed and withdrew. \"Well, five then,\" I answered, \"just to oblige\\r\\nyour Serenity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA secretary, after all, can do a great deal. When it came to the\\r\\nscratch, I had but little difficulty in persuading Sir Charles, with\\r\\nAmelia\\'s aid, backed up on either side by Isabel and C\\xc3\\xa9sarine, to\\r\\naccede to the Count\\'s more reasonable proposal. The Southampton Row\\r\\npeople had possession of certain facts as to the value of the wines\\r\\nin the Bordeaux market which clinched the matter. In a week or two\\r\\nall was settled; Charles and I met the Count by appointment in\\r\\nSouthampton Row, and saw him sign, seal, and deliver the title-deeds\\r\\nof Schloss Lebenstein. My brother-in-law paid the purchase-money\\r\\ninto the Count\\'s own hands, by cheque, crossed on a first-class\\r\\nLondon firm where the Count kept an account to his high well-born\\r\\norder. Then he went away with the proud knowledge that he was owner\\r\\nof Schloss Lebenstein. And what to me was more important still,\\r\\nI received next morning by post a cheque for the five per cent,\\r\\nunfortunately drawn, by some misapprehension, to my order on the\\r\\nself-same bankers, and with the Count\\'s signature. He explained in\\r\\nthe accompanying note that the matter being now quite satisfactorily\\r\\nconcluded, he saw no reason of delicacy why the amount he had\\r\\npromised should not be paid to me forthwith direct in money.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cashed the cheque at once, and said nothing about the affair, not\\r\\neven to Isabel. My experience is that women are not to be trusted\\r\\nwith intricate matters of commission and brokerage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough it was now late in March, and the House was sitting, Charles\\r\\ninsisted that we must all run over at once to take possession of our\\r\\nmagnificent Tyrolese castle. Amelia was almost equally burning with\\r\\neagerness. She gave herself the airs of a Countess already. We took\\r\\nthe Orient Express as far as Munich; then the Brenner to Meran,\\r\\nand put up for the night at the Erzherzog Johann. Though we had\\r\\ntelegraphed our arrival, and expected some fuss, there was no\\r\\ndemonstration. Next morning we drove out in state to the schloss,\\r\\nto enter into enjoyment of our vines and fig-trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were met at the door by the surly steward. \"I shall dismiss\\r\\nthat man,\" Charles muttered, as Lord of Lebenstein. \"He\\'s too\\r\\nsour-looking for my taste. Never saw such a brute. Not a smile\\r\\nof welcome!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe mounted the steps. The surly man stepped forward and murmured a\\r\\nfew morose words in German. Charles brushed him aside and strode on.\\r\\nThen there followed a curious scene of mutual misunderstanding. The\\r\\nsurly man called lustily for his servants to eject us. It was some\\r\\ntime before we began to catch at the truth. The surly man was the\\r\\n_real_ Graf von Lebenstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Count with the moustache? It dawned upon us now. Colonel\\r\\nClay again! More audacious than ever!\\r\\n\\r\\nBit by bit it all came out. He had ridden behind us the first day\\r\\nwe viewed the place, and, giving himself out to the servants as\\r\\none of our party, had joined us in the reception-room. We asked\\r\\nthe real Count why he had spoken to the intruder. The Count\\r\\nexplained in French that the man with the moustache had introduced\\r\\nmy brother-in-law as the great South African millionaire, while he\\r\\ndescribed himself as our courier and interpreter. As such he had\\r\\nhad frequent interviews with the real Graf and his lawyers in\\r\\nMeran, and had driven almost daily across to the castle. The owner\\r\\nof the estate had named one price from the first, and had stuck to\\r\\nit manfully. He stuck to it still; and if Sir Charles chose to buy\\r\\nSchloss Lebenstein over again he was welcome to have it. How the\\r\\nLondon lawyers had been duped the Count had not really the slightest\\r\\nidea. He regretted the incident, and (coldly) wished us a very good\\r\\nmorning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing for it but to return as best we might to the\\r\\nErzherzog Johann, crestfallen, and telegraph particulars to the\\r\\npolice in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles and I ran across post-haste to England to track down the\\r\\nvillain. At Southampton Row we found the legal firm by no means\\r\\npenitent; on the contrary, they were indignant at the way we had\\r\\ndeceived them. An impostor had written to them on Lebenstein\\r\\npaper from Meran to say that he was coming to London to negotiate\\r\\nthe sale of the schloss and surrounding property with the\\r\\nfamous millionaire, Sir Charles Vandrift; and Sir Charles had\\r\\ndemonstratively recognised him at sight as the real Count von\\r\\nLebenstein. The firm had never seen the present Graf at all, and\\r\\nhad swallowed the impostor whole, so to speak, on the strength of\\r\\nSir Charles\\'s obvious recognition. He had brought over as documents\\r\\nsome most excellent forgeries--facsimiles of the originals--which,\\r\\nas our courier and interpreter, he had every opportunity of\\r\\nexamining and inspecting at the Meran lawyers\\'. It was a deeply-laid\\r\\nplot, and it had succeeded to a marvel. Yet, all of it depended\\r\\nupon the one small fact that we had accepted the man with the long\\r\\nmoustache in the hall of the schloss as the Count von Lebenstein on\\r\\nhis own representation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held our cards in his hands when he came in; and the servant had\\r\\n_not_ given them to him, but to the genuine Count. That was the one\\r\\nunsolved mystery in the whole adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the evening\\'s post two letters arrived for us at Sir Charles\\'s\\r\\nhouse: one for myself, and one for my employer. Sir Charles\\'s ran\\r\\nthus:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HIGH WELL-BORN INCOMPETENCE,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I only just pulled through! A very small slip nearly lost me\\r\\neverything. I believed you were going to Schloss Planta that day,\\r\\nnot to Schloss Lebenstein. You changed your mind en route. That\\r\\nmight have spoiled all. Happily I perceived it, rode up by the short\\r\\ncut, and arrived somewhat hurriedly and hotly at the gate before\\r\\nyou. Then I introduced myself. I had one more bad moment when the\\r\\nrival claimant to my name and title intruded into the room. But\\r\\nfortune favours the brave: your utter ignorance of German saved me.\\r\\nThe rest was pap. It went by itself almost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Allow me, now, as some small return for your various welcome\\r\\ncheques, to offer you a useful and valuable present--a German\\r\\ndictionary, grammar, and phrase-book!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I kiss your hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No longer\\r\\n\\r\\n\"VON LEBENSTEIN.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other note was to me. It was as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR GOOD MR. VENTVORTH,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha, ha, ha; just a W misplaced sufficed to take you in, then! And\\r\\nI risked the TH, though anybody with a head on his shoulders would\\r\\nsurely have known our TH is by far more difficult than our W for\\r\\nforeigners! However, all\\'s well that ends well; and now I\\'ve got\\r\\nyou. The Lord has delivered you into my hands, dear friend--on your\\r\\nown initiative. I hold my cheque, endorsed by you, and cashed at my\\r\\nbanker\\'s, as a hostage, so to speak, for your future good behaviour.\\r\\nIf ever you recognise me, and betray me to that solemn old ass, your\\r\\nemployer, remember, I expose it, and you with it to him. So now we\\r\\nunderstand each other. I had not thought of this little dodge; it\\r\\nwas you who suggested it. However, I jumped at it. Was it not well\\r\\nworth my while paying you that slight commission in return for a\\r\\nguarantee of your future silence? Your mouth is now closed. And\\r\\ncheap too at the price.--Yours, dear Comrade, in the great\\r\\nconfraternity of rogues,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"CUTHBERT CLAY, Colonel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles laid his note down, and grizzled. \"What\\'s yours, Sey?\"\\r\\nhe asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From a lady,\" I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gazed at me suspiciously. \"Oh, I thought it was the same hand,\"\\r\\nhe said. His eye looked through me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" I answered. \"Mrs. Mortimer\\'s.\" But I confess I trembled.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused a moment. \"You made all inquiries at this fellow\\'s bank?\"\\r\\nhe went on, after a deep sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, yes,\" I put in quickly. (I had taken good care about that,\\r\\nyou may be sure, lest he should spot the commission.) \"They say\\r\\nthe self-styled Count von Lebenstein was introduced to them by\\r\\nthe Southampton Row folks, and drew, as usual, on the Lebenstein\\r\\naccount: so they were quite unsuspicious. A rascal who goes about\\r\\nthe world on that scale, you know, and arrives with such credentials\\r\\nas theirs and yours, naturally imposes on anybody. The bank didn\\'t\\r\\neven require to have him formally identified. The firm was enough.\\r\\nHe came to pay money in, not to draw it out. And he withdrew his\\r\\nbalance just two days later, saying he was in a hurry to get back\\r\\nto Vienna.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWould he ask for items? I confess I felt it was an awkward moment.\\r\\nCharles, however, was too full of regrets to bother about the\\r\\naccount. He leaned back in his easy chair, stuck his hands in his\\r\\npockets, held his legs straight out on the fender before him, and\\r\\nlooked the very picture of hopeless despondency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sey,\" he began, after a minute or two, poking the fire,\\r\\nreflectively, \"what a genius that man has! \\'Pon my soul, I\\r\\nadmire him. I sometimes wish--\" He broke off and hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, Charles?\" I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I sometimes wish ... we had got him on the Board of the Cloetedorp\\r\\nGolcondas. Mag--nificent combinations he would make in the City!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI rose from my seat and stared solemnly at my misguided\\r\\nbrother-in-law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Charles,\" I said, \"you are beside yourself. Too much Colonel Clay\\r\\nhas told upon your clear and splendid intellect. There are certain\\r\\nremarks which, however true they may be, no self-respecting\\r\\nfinancier should permit himself to make, even in the privacy of\\r\\nhis own room, to his most intimate friend and trusted adviser.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles fairly broke down. \"You are right, Sey,\" he sobbed out.\\r\\n\"Quite right. Forgive this outburst. At moments of emotion the\\r\\ntruth will sometimes out, in spite of everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI respected his feebleness. I did not even make it a fitting\\r\\noccasion to ask for a trifling increase of salary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE DRAWN GAME\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe twelfth of August saw us, as usual, at Seldon Castle,\\r\\nRoss-shire. It is part of Charles\\'s restless, roving temperament\\r\\nthat, on the morning of the eleventh, wet or fine, he must set out\\r\\nfrom London, whether the House is sitting or not, in defiance of\\r\\nthe most urgent three-line whips; and at dawn on the twelfth he must\\r\\nbe at work on his moors, shooting down the young birds with might\\r\\nand main, at the earliest possible legal moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe goes on like Saul, slaying his thousands, or, like David, his\\r\\ntens of thousands, with all the guns in the house to help him, till\\r\\nthe keepers warn him he has killed as many grouse as they consider\\r\\ndesirable; and then, having done his duty, as he thinks, in this\\r\\nrespect, he retires precipitately with flying colours to Brighton,\\r\\nNice, Monte Carlo, or elsewhere. He must be always \"on the trek\";\\r\\nwhen he is buried, I believe he will not be able to rest quiet in\\r\\nhis grave: his ghost will walk the world to terrify old ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At Seldon, at least,\" he said to me, with a sigh, as he stepped\\r\\ninto his Pullman, \"I shall be safe from that impostor!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd indeed, as soon as he had begun to tire a little of counting\\r\\nup his hundreds of brace per diem, he found a trifling piece of\\r\\nfinancial work cut ready to his hand, which amply distracted his\\r\\nmind for the moment from Colonel Clay, his accomplices, and his\\r\\nvillainies.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles, I ought to say, had secured during that summer a very\\r\\nadvantageous option in a part of Africa on the Transvaal frontier,\\r\\nrumoured to be auriferous. Now, whether it was auriferous or not\\r\\nbefore, the mere fact that Charles had secured some claim on it\\r\\nnaturally made it so; for no man had ever the genuine Midas-touch\\r\\nto a greater degree than Charles Vandrift: whatever he handles turns\\r\\nat once to gold, if not to diamonds. Therefore, as soon as my\\r\\nbrother-in-law had obtained this option from the native vendor (a\\r\\nmost respected chief, by name Montsioa), and promoted a company\\r\\nof his own to develop it, his great rival in that region, Lord\\r\\nCraig-Ellachie (formerly Sir David Alexander Granton), immediately\\r\\nsecured a similar option of an adjacent track, the larger part of\\r\\nwhich had pretty much the same geological conditions as that covered\\r\\nby Sir Charles\\'s right of pre-emption.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were not wholly disappointed, as it turned out, in the result.\\r\\nA month or two later, while we were still at Seldon, we received\\r\\na long and encouraging letter from our prospectors on the spot,\\r\\nwho had been hunting over the ground in search of gold-reefs. They\\r\\nreported that they had found a good auriferous vein in a corner of\\r\\nthe tract, approachable by adit-levels; but, unfortunately, only a\\r\\nfew yards of the lode lay within the limits of Sir Charles\\'s area.\\r\\nThe remainder ran on at once into what was locally known as\\r\\nCraig-Ellachie\\'s section.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, our prospectors had been canny, they said; though young\\r\\nMr. Granton was prospecting at the same time, in the self-same\\r\\nridge, not very far from them, his miners had failed to discover\\r\\nthe auriferous quartz; so our men had held their tongues about it,\\r\\nwisely leaving it for Charles to govern himself accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you dispute the boundary?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible,\" Charles answered. \"You see, the limit is a meridian\\r\\nof longitude. There\\'s no getting over that. Can\\'t pretend to deny\\r\\nit. No buying over the sun! No bribing the instruments! Besides,\\r\\nwe drew the line ourselves. We\\'ve only one way out of it, Sey.\\r\\nAmalgamate! Amalgamate!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles is a marvellous man! The very voice in which he murmured\\r\\nthat blessed word \"Amalgamate!\" was in itself a poem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Capital!\" I answered. \"Say nothing about it, and join forces with\\r\\nCraig-Ellachie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles closed one eye pensively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat very same evening came a telegram in cipher from our chief\\r\\nengineer on the territory of the option: \"Young Granton has somehow\\r\\ngiven us the slip and gone home. We suspect he knows all. But we\\r\\nhave not divulged the secret to anybody.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seymour,\" my brother-in-law said impressively, \"there is no time to\\r\\nbe lost. I must write this evening to Sir David--I mean to My Lord.\\r\\nDo you happen to know where he is stopping at present?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Morning Post announced two or three days ago that he was at\\r\\nGlen-Ellachie,\" I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then I\\'ll ask him to come over and thrash the matter out with me,\"\\r\\nmy brother-in-law went on. \"A very rich reef, they say. I must have\\r\\nmy finger in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe adjourned into the study, where Sir Charles drafted, I must\\r\\nadmit, a most judicious letter to the rival capitalist. He pointed\\r\\nout that the mineral resources of the country were probably great,\\r\\nbut as yet uncertain. That the expense of crushing and milling might\\r\\nbe almost prohibitive. That access to fuel was costly, and its\\r\\nconveyance difficult. That water was scarce, and commanded by our\\r\\nsection. That two rival companies, if they happened to hit upon ore,\\r\\nmight cut one another\\'s throats by erecting two sets of furnaces or\\r\\npumping plants, and bringing two separate streams to the spot,\\r\\nwhere one would answer. In short--to employ the golden word--that\\r\\namalgamation might prove better in the end than competition; and\\r\\nthat he advised, at least, a conference on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wrote it out fair for him, and Sir Charles, with the air of a\\r\\nCromwell, signed it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is important, Sey,\" he said. \"It had better be registered,\\r\\nfor fear of falling into improper hands. Don\\'t give it to Dobson;\\r\\nlet C\\xc3\\xa9sarine take it over to Fowlis in the dog-cart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the drawback of Seldon that we are twelve miles from a\\r\\nrailway station, though we look out on one of the loveliest firths\\r\\nin Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\xc3\\xa9sarine took it as directed--an invaluable servant, that girl!\\r\\nMeanwhile, we learned from the Morning Post next day that young\\r\\nMr. Granton had stolen a march upon us. He had arrived from Africa\\r\\nby the same mail with our agent\\'s letter, and had joined his father\\r\\nat once at Glen-Ellachie.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days later we received a most polite reply from the opposing\\r\\ninterest. It ran after this fashion:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"CRAIG-ELLACHIE LODGE,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"GLEN-ELLACHIE, INVERNESS-SHIRE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAR SIR CHARLES VANDRIFT--Thanks for yours of the 20th. In reply,\\r\\nI can only say I fully reciprocate your amiable desire that nothing\\r\\nadverse to either of our companies should happen in South Africa.\\r\\nWith regard to your suggestion that we should meet in person, to\\r\\ndiscuss the basis of a possible amalgamation, I can only say my\\r\\nhouse is at present full of guests--as is doubtless your own--and\\r\\nI should therefore find it practically impossible to leave\\r\\nGlen-Ellachie. Fortunately, however, my son David is now at home\\r\\non a brief holiday from Kimberley; and it will give him great\\r\\npleasure to come over and hear what you have to say in favour of an\\r\\narrangement which certainly, on some grounds, seems to me desirable\\r\\nin the interests of both our concessions alike. He will arrive\\r\\nto-morrow afternoon at Seldon, and he is authorised, in every\\r\\nrespect, to negotiate with full powers on behalf of myself and the\\r\\nother directors. With kindest regards to your wife and sons, I\\r\\nremain, dear Sir Charles, yours faithfully,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"CRAIG-ELLACHIE.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Cunning old fox!\" Sir Charles exclaimed, with a sniff. \"What\\'s he\\r\\nup to now, I wonder? Seems almost as anxious to amalgamate as we\\r\\nourselves are, Sey.\" A sudden thought struck him. \"Do you know,\"\\r\\nhe cried, looking up, \"I really believe the same thing must have\\r\\nhappened to _both_ our exploring parties. _They_ must have found a\\r\\nreef that goes under _our_ ground, and the wicked old rascal wants\\r\\nto cheat us out of it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As we want to cheat him,\" I ventured to interpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles looked at me fixedly. \"Well, if so, we\\'re both in luck,\"\\r\\nhe murmured, after a pause; \"though _we_ can only get to know the\\r\\nwhereabouts of _their_ find by joining hands with them and showing\\r\\nthem ours. Still, it\\'s good business either way. But I shall be\\r\\ncautious--cautious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a nuisance!\" Amelia cried, when we told her of the incident.\\r\\n\"I suppose I shall have to put the man up for the night--a nasty,\\r\\nraw-boned, half-baked Scotchman, you may be certain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Wednesday afternoon, about three, young Granton arrived. He was\\r\\na pleasant-featured, red-haired, sandy-whiskered youth, not unlike\\r\\nhis father; but, strange to say, he dropped in to call, instead of\\r\\nbringing his luggage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you\\'re not going back to Glen-Ellachie to-night, surely?\"\\r\\nCharles exclaimed, in amazement. \"Lady Vandrift will be _so_\\r\\ndisappointed! Besides, this business can\\'t be arranged between\\r\\ntwo trains, do you think, Mr. Granton?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Granton smiled. He had an agreeable smile--canny, yet open.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh no,\" he said frankly. \"I didn\\'t mean to go back. I\\'ve put up at\\r\\nthe inn. I have my wife with me, you know--and, I wasn\\'t invited.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAmelia was of opinion, when we told her this episode, that David\\r\\nGranton wouldn\\'t stop at Seldon because he was an Honourable.\\r\\nIsabel was of opinion he wouldn\\'t stop because he had married an\\r\\nunpresentable young woman somewhere out in South Africa. Charles was\\r\\nof opinion that, as representative of the hostile interest, he put\\r\\nup at the inn, because it might tie his hands in some way to be the\\r\\nguest of the chairman of the rival company. And _I_ was of opinion\\r\\nthat he had heard of the castle, and knew it well by report as the\\r\\ndullest country-house to stay at in Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever that may be, young Granton insisted on remaining at the\\r\\nCromarty Arms, though he told us his wife would be delighted to\\r\\nreceive a call from Lady Vandrift and Mrs. Wentworth. So we all\\r\\nreturned with him to bring the Honourable Mrs. Granton up to tea\\r\\nat the Castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a nice little thing, very shy and timid, but by no means\\r\\nunpresentable, and an evident lady. She giggled at the end of every\\r\\nsentence; and she was endowed with a slight squint, which somehow\\r\\nseemed to point all her feeble sallies. She knew little outside\\r\\nSouth Africa; but of that she talked prettily; and she won all\\r\\nour hearts, in spite of the cast in her eye, by her unaffected\\r\\nsimplicity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning Charles and I had a regular debate with young Granton\\r\\nabout the rival options. Our talk was of cyanide processes,\\r\\nreverberatories, pennyweights, water-jackets. But it dawned upon us\\r\\nsoon that, in spite of his red hair and his innocent manners, our\\r\\nfriend, the Honourable David Granton, knew a thing or two. Gradually\\r\\nand gracefully he let us see that Lord Craig-Ellachie had sent him\\r\\nfor the benefit of the company, but that _he_ had come for the\\r\\nbenefit of the Honourable David Granton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m a younger son, Sir Charles,\" he said; \"and therefore I have to\\r\\nfeather my nest for myself. I know the ground. My father will be\\r\\nguided implicitly by what I advise in the matter. We are men of the\\r\\nworld. Now, let\\'s be business-like. _You_ want to amalgamate. You\\r\\nwouldn\\'t do that, of course, if you didn\\'t know of something to the\\r\\nadvantage of my father\\'s company--say, a lode on our land--which you\\r\\nhope to secure for yourself by amalgamation. Very well; _I_ can make\\r\\nor mar your project. If you choose to render it worth my while, I\\'ll\\r\\ninduce my father and his directors to amalgamate. If you don\\'t, I\\r\\nwon\\'t. That\\'s the long and the short of it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles looked at him admiringly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Young man,\" he said, \"you\\'re deep, very deep--for your age. Is this\\r\\ncandour--or deception? Do you mean what you say? Or do you know some\\r\\nreason why it suits your father\\'s book to amalgamate as well as it\\r\\nsuits mine? And are you trying to keep it from me?\" He fingered his\\r\\nchin. \"If I only knew that,\" he went on, \"I should know how to deal\\r\\nwith you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Granton smiled again. \"You\\'re a financier, Sir Charles,\" he\\r\\nanswered. \"I wonder, at your time of life, you should pause to ask\\r\\nanother financier whether he\\'s trying to fill his own pocket--or his\\r\\nfather\\'s. Whatever is my father\\'s goes to his eldest son--and _I_ am\\r\\nhis youngest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are right as to general principles,\" Sir Charles replied, quite\\r\\naffectionately. \"Most sound and sensible. But how do I know you\\r\\nhaven\\'t bargained already in the same way with your father? You\\r\\nmay have settled with _him_, and be trying to diddle me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man assumed a most candid air. \"Look here,\" he said,\\r\\nleaning forward. \"I offer you this chance. Take it or leave it. _Do_\\r\\nyou wish to purchase my aid for this amalgamation by a moderate\\r\\ncommission on the net value of my father\\'s option to yourself--which\\r\\nI know approximately?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Say five per cent,\" I suggested, in a tentative voice, just to\\r\\njustify my presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked me through and through. \"_Ten_ is more usual,\" he\\r\\nanswered, in a peculiar tone and with a peculiar glance.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat heavens, how I winced! I knew what his words meant. They were\\r\\nthe very words I had said myself to Colonel Clay, as the Count von\\r\\nLebenstein, about the purchase-money of the schloss--and in the very\\r\\nsame accent. I saw through it all now. That beastly cheque! This\\r\\nwas Colonel Clay; and he was trying to buy up my silence and\\r\\nassistance by the threat of exposure!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy blood ran cold. I didn\\'t know how to answer him. What happened\\r\\nat the rest of that interview I really couldn\\'t tell you. My brain\\r\\nreeled round. I heard just faint echoes of \"fuel\" and \"reduction\\r\\nworks.\" What on earth was I to do? If I told Charles my\\r\\nsuspicion--for it was only a suspicion--the fellow might turn upon\\r\\nme and disclose the cheque, which would suffice to ruin me. If I\\r\\ndidn\\'t, I ran a risk of being considered by Charles an accomplice\\r\\nand a confederate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interview was long. I hardly know how I struggled through it.\\r\\nAt the end young Granton went off, well satisfied, if it was young\\r\\nGranton; and Amelia invited him and his wife up to dinner at the\\r\\ncastle.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever else they were, they were capital company. They stopped\\r\\nfor three days more at the Cromarty Arms. And Charles debated and\\r\\ndiscussed incessantly. He couldn\\'t quite make up his mind what to\\r\\ndo in the affair; and _I_ certainly couldn\\'t help him. I never was\\r\\nplaced in such a fix in my life. I did my best to preserve a strict\\r\\nneutrality.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Granton, it turned out, was a most agreeable person; and so,\\r\\nin her way, was that timid, unpretending South African wife of his.\\r\\nShe was naively surprised Amelia had never met her mamma at Durban.\\r\\nThey both talked delightfully, and had lots of good stories--mostly\\r\\nwith points that told against the Craig-Ellachie people. Moreover,\\r\\nthe Honourable David was a splendid swimmer. He went out in a boat\\r\\nwith us, and dived like a seal. He was burning to teach Charles\\r\\nand myself to swim, when we told him we could neither of us take a\\r\\nsingle stroke; he said it was an accomplishment incumbent upon every\\r\\ntrue Englishman. But Charles hates the water; while, as for myself,\\r\\nI detest every known form of muscular exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, we consented that he should row us on the Firth, and made\\r\\nan appointment one day with himself and his wife for four the next\\r\\nevening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night Charles came to me with a very grave face in my own\\r\\nbedroom. \"Sey,\" he said, under his breath, \"have you observed?\\r\\nHave you watched? Have you any suspicions?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI trembled violently. I felt all was up. \"Suspicions of whom?\"\\r\\nI asked. \"Not surely of Simpson?\" (he was Sir Charles\\'s valet).\\r\\n\\r\\nMy respected brother-in-law looked at me contemptuously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sey,\" he said, \"are you trying to take me in? No, _not_ of Simpson:\\r\\nof these two young folks. My own belief is--they\\'re Colonel Clay\\r\\nand Madame Picardet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Impossible!\" I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded. \"I\\'m sure of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you know?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Instinctively.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI seized his arm. \"Charles,\" I said, imploring him, \"do nothing\\r\\nrash. Remember how you exposed yourself to the ridicule of fools\\r\\nover Dr. Polperro!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ve thought of that,\" he answered, \"and I mean to ca\\' caller.\"\\r\\n(When in Scotland as laird of Seldon, Charles loves both to dress\\r\\nand to speak the part thoroughly.) \"First thing to-morrow I shall\\r\\ntelegraph over to inquire at Glen-Ellachie; I shall find out\\r\\nwhether this is really young Granton or not; meanwhile, I shall keep\\r\\nmy eye close upon the fellow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly next morning, accordingly, a groom was dispatched with a\\r\\ntelegram to Lord Craig-Ellachie. He was to ride over to Fowlis, send\\r\\nit off at once, and wait for the answer. At the same time, as it was\\r\\nprobable Lord Craig-Ellachie would have started for the moors before\\r\\nthe telegram reached the Lodge, I did not myself expect to see the\\r\\nreply arrive much before seven or eight that evening. Meanwhile, as\\r\\nit was far from certain we had not the real David Granton to deal\\r\\nwith, it was necessary to be polite to our friendly rivals. Our\\r\\nexperience in the Polperro incident had shown us both that too much\\r\\nzeal may be more dangerous than too little. Nevertheless, taught\\r\\nby previous misfortunes, we kept watching our man pretty close,\\r\\ndetermined that on this occasion, at least, he should neither do us\\r\\nnor yet escape us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout four o\\'clock the red-haired young man and his pretty little\\r\\nwife came up to call for us. She looked so charming and squinted\\r\\nso enchantingly, one could hardly believe she was not as simple\\r\\nand innocent as she seemed to be. She tripped down to the Seldon\\r\\nboat-house, with Charles by her side, giggling and squinting her\\r\\nbest, and then helped her husband to get the skiff ready. As she did\\r\\nso, Charles sidled up to me. \"Sey,\" he whispered, \"I\\'m an old hand,\\r\\nand I\\'m not readily taken in. I\\'ve been talking to that girl, and\\r\\nupon my soul I think she\\'s all right. She\\'s a charming little lady.\\r\\nWe may be mistaken after all, of course, about young Granton. In any\\r\\ncase, it\\'s well for the present to be courteous. A most important\\r\\noption! If it\\'s really he, we must do nothing to annoy him or let\\r\\nhim see we suspect him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had noticed, indeed, that Mrs. Granton had made herself most\\r\\nagreeable to Charles from the very beginning. And as to one thing he\\r\\nwas right. In her timid, shrinking way she was undeniably charming.\\r\\nThat cast in her eye was all pure piquancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe rowed out on to the Firth, or, to be more strictly correct, the\\r\\ntwo Grantons rowed while Charles and I sat and leaned back in the\\r\\nstern on the luxurious cushions. They rowed fast and well. In a very\\r\\nfew minutes they had rounded the point and got clear out of sight\\r\\nof the Cockneyfied towers and false battlements of Seldon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Granton pulled stroke. Even as she rowed she kept up a brisk\\r\\nundercurrent of timid chaff with Sir Charles, giggling all the\\r\\nwhile, half forward, half shy, like a school-girl who flirts with\\r\\na man old enough to be her grandfather.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles was flattered. He is susceptible to the pleasures of\\r\\nfemale attention, especially from the young, the simple, and the\\r\\ninnocent. The wiles of women of the world he knows too well; but a\\r\\npretty little ing\\xc3\\xa9nue can twist him round her finger. They rowed on\\r\\nand on, till they drew abreast of Seamew\\'s island. It is a jagged\\r\\nstack or skerry, well out to sea, very wild and precipitous on the\\r\\nlandward side, but shelving gently outward; perhaps an acre in\\r\\nextent, with steep gray cliffs, covered at that time with crimson\\r\\nmasses of red valerian. Mrs. Granton rowed up close to it. \"Oh, what\\r\\nlovely flowers!\" she cried, throwing her head back and gazing at\\r\\nthem. \"I wish I could get some! Let\\'s land here and pick them. Sir\\r\\nCharles, you shall gather me a nice bunch for my sitting-room.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles rose to it innocently, like a trout to a fly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By all means, my dear child, I--I have a passion for flowers;\"\\r\\nwhich was a flower of speech itself, but it served its purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey rowed us round to the far side, where is the easiest\\r\\nlanding-place. It struck me as odd at the moment that they seemed\\r\\nto know it. Then young Granton jumped lightly ashore; Mrs. Granton\\r\\nskipped after him. I confess it made me feel rather ashamed to see\\r\\nhow clumsily Charles and I followed them, treading gingerly on the\\r\\nthwarts for fear of upsetting the boat, while the artless young\\r\\nthing just flew over the gunwale. So like White Heather! However,\\r\\nwe got ashore at last in safety, and began to climb the rocks as\\r\\nwell as we were able in search of the valerian.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudge of our astonishment when next moment those two young people\\r\\nbounded back into the boat, pushed off with a peal of merry\\r\\nlaughter, and left us there staring at them!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey rowed away, about twenty yards, into deep water. Then the man\\r\\nturned, and waved his hand at us gracefully. \"Good-bye!\" he said,\\r\\n\"good-bye! Hope you\\'ll pick a nice bunch! We\\'re off to London!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Off!\" Charles exclaimed, turning pale. \"Off! What do you mean?\\r\\nYou don\\'t surely mean to say you\\'re going to leave us here?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man raised his cap with perfect politeness, while Mrs.\\r\\nGranton smiled, nodded, and kissed her pretty hand to us. \"Yes,\"\\r\\nhe answered; \"for the present. We retire from the game. The fact\\r\\nof it is, it\\'s a trifle too thin: this is a coup manqu\\xc3\\xa9.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A _what_?\" Charles exclaimed, perspiring visibly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A coup manqu\\xc3\\xa9,\" the young man replied, with a compassionate smile.\\r\\n\"A failure, don\\'t you know; a bad shot; a fiasco. I learn from\\r\\nmy scouts that you sent a telegram by special messenger to Lord\\r\\nCraig-Ellachie this morning. That shows you suspect me. Now, it is a\\r\\nprinciple of my system never to go on for one move with a game when\\r\\nI find myself suspected. The slightest symptom of distrust, and--I\\r\\nback out immediately. My plans can only be worked to satisfaction\\r\\nwhen there is perfect confidence on the part of my patient. It is\\r\\na well-known rule of the medical profession. I _never_ try to bleed\\r\\na man who struggles. So now we\\'re off. Ta-ta! Good luck to you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not much more than twenty yards away, and could talk to us\\r\\nquite easily. But the water was deep; the islet rose sheer from I\\'m\\r\\nsure I don\\'t know how many fathoms of sea; and we could neither of\\r\\nus swim. Charles stretched out his arms imploringly. \"For Heaven\\'s\\r\\nsake,\" he cried, \"don\\'t tell me you really mean to leave us here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked so comical in his distress and terror that Mrs.\\r\\nGranton--Madame Picardet--whatever I am to call her--laughed\\r\\nmelodiously in her prettiest way at the sight of him. \"Dear Sir\\r\\nCharles,\" she called out, \"pray don\\'t be afraid! It\\'s only a\\r\\nshort and temporary imprisonment. We will send men to take you off.\\r\\nDear David and I only need just time enough to get well ashore and\\r\\nmake--oh!--a few slight alterations in our personal appearance.\"\\r\\nAnd she indicated with her hand, laughing, dear David\\'s red wig and\\r\\nfalse sandy whiskers, as we felt convinced they must be now. She\\r\\nlooked at them and tittered. Her manner at this moment was anything\\r\\nbut shy. In fact, I will venture to say, it was that of a bold and\\r\\nbrazen-faced hoyden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you _are_ Colonel Clay!\" Sir Charles cried, mopping his brow\\r\\nwith his handkerchief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you choose to call me so,\" the young man answered politely. \"I\\'m\\r\\nsure it\\'s most kind of you to supply me with a commission in Her\\r\\nMajesty\\'s service. However, time presses, and we want to push off.\\r\\nDon\\'t alarm yourselves unnecessarily. I will send a boat to take you\\r\\naway from this rock at the earliest possible moment consistent with\\r\\nmy personal safety and my dear companion\\'s.\" He laid his hand on his\\r\\nheart and struck a sentimental attitude. \"I have received too many\\r\\nunwilling kindnesses at your hands, Sir Charles,\" he continued,\\r\\n\"not to feel how wrong it would be of me to inconvenience you for\\r\\nnothing. Rest assured that you shall be rescued by midnight at\\r\\nlatest. Fortunately, the weather just at present is warm, and I see\\r\\nno chance of rain; so you will suffer, if at all, from nothing worse\\r\\nthan the pangs of temporary hunger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Granton, no longer squinting--\\'twas a mere trick she had\\r\\nassumed--rose up in the boat and stretched out a rug to us. \"Catch!\"\\r\\nshe cried, in a merry voice, and flung it at us, doubled. It fell\\r\\nat our feet; she was a capital thrower.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, you dear Sir Charles,\" she went on, \"take that to keep you\\r\\nwarm! You know I am really quite fond of you. You\\'re not half a\\r\\nbad old boy when one takes you the right way. You have a human side\\r\\nto you. Why, I often wear that sweetly pretty brooch you gave me\\r\\nat Nice, when I was Madame Picardet! And I\\'m sure your goodness to\\r\\nme at Lucerne, when I was the little curate\\'s wife, is a thing to\\r\\nremember. We\\'re so glad to have seen you in your lovely Scotch\\r\\nhome you were always so proud of! _Don\\'t_ be frightened, please. We\\r\\nwouldn\\'t hurt you for worlds. We _are_ so sorry we have to take this\\r\\ninhospitable means of evading you. But dear David--I _must_ call\\r\\nhim dear David still--instinctively felt that you were beginning to\\r\\nsuspect us; and he can\\'t bear mistrust. He _is_ so sensitive! The\\r\\nmoment people mistrust him, he _must_ break off with them at once.\\r\\nThis was the only way to get you both off our hands while we make\\r\\nthe needful little arrangements to depart; and we\\'ve been driven to\\r\\navail ourselves of it. However, I will give you my word of honour,\\r\\nas a lady, you shall be fetched away to-night. If dear David doesn\\'t\\r\\ndo it, why, I\\'ll do it myself.\" And she blew another kiss to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was half beside himself, divided between alternate terror\\r\\nand anger. \"Oh, we shall die here!\" he exclaimed. \"Nobody\\'d ever\\r\\ndream of coming to this rock to search for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What a pity you didn\\'t let me teach you to swim!\" Colonel Clay\\r\\ninterposed. \"It is a noble exercise, and very useful indeed in such\\r\\nspecial emergencies! Well, ta-ta! I\\'m off! You nearly scored one\\r\\nthis time; but, by putting you here for the moment, and keeping you\\r\\ntill we\\'re gone, I venture to say I\\'ve redressed the board, and I\\r\\nthink we may count it a drawn game, mayn\\'t we? The match stands at\\r\\nthree, love--with some thousands in pocket?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re a murderer, sir!\" Charles shrieked out. \"We shall starve or\\r\\ndie here!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Clay on his side was all sweet reasonableness. \"Now, my dear\\r\\nsir,\" he expostulated, one hand held palm outward, \"_Do_ you think\\r\\nit probable I would kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, with\\r\\nso little compunction? No, no, Sir Charles Vandrift; I know too well\\r\\nhow much you are worth to me. I return you on my income-tax paper\\r\\nas five thousand a year, clear profit of my profession. Suppose you\\r\\nwere to die! I might be compelled to find some new and far less\\r\\nlucrative source of plunder. Your heirs, executors, or assignees\\r\\nmight not suit my purpose. The fact of it is, sir, your temperament\\r\\nand mine are exactly adapted one to the other. _I_ understand _you_;\\r\\nand _you_ do not understand _me_--which is often the basis of the\\r\\nfirmest friendships. I can catch you just where you are trying to\\r\\ncatch other people. Your very smartness assists me; for I admit you\\r\\n_are_ smart. As a regular financier, I allow, I couldn\\'t hold a\\r\\ncandle to you. But in my humbler walk of life I know just how to\\r\\nutilise you. I lead you on, where you think you are going to gain some\\r\\nadvantage over others; and by dexterously playing upon your love of\\r\\na good bargain, your innate desire to best somebody else--I succeed\\r\\nin besting you. There, sir, you have the philosophy of our mutual\\r\\nrelations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bowed and raised his cap. Charles looked at him and cowered. Yes,\\r\\ngenius as he is, he positively cowered. \"And do you mean to say,\"\\r\\nhe burst out, \"you intend to go on so bleeding me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colonel smiled a bland smile. \"Sir Charles Vandrift,\" he\\r\\nanswered, \"I called you just now the goose that lays the golden\\r\\neggs. You may have thought the metaphor a rude one. But you _are_\\r\\na goose, you know, in certain relations. Smartest man on the Stock\\r\\nExchange, I readily admit; easiest fool to bamboozle in the\\r\\nopen country that ever I met with. You fail in one thing--the\\r\\nperspicacity of simplicity. For that reason, among others, I have\\r\\nchosen to fasten upon you. Regard me, my dear sir, as a microbe of\\r\\nmillionaires, a parasite upon capitalists. You know the old rhyme:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite \\'em,\\r\\n  And these again have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum!\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, that\\'s just how I view myself. _You_ are a capitalist and a\\r\\nmillionaire. In _your_ large way you prey upon society. YOU deal in\\r\\nCorners, Options, Concessions, Syndicates. You drain the world\\r\\ndry of its blood and its money. You possess, like the mosquito, a\\r\\nbeautiful instrument of suction--Founders\\' Shares--with which you\\r\\nabsorb the surplus wealth of the community. In _my_ smaller way,\\r\\nagain, _I_ relieve you in turn of a portion of the plunder. I am a\\r\\nRobin Hood of my age; and, looking upon _you_ as an exceptionally bad\\r\\nform of millionaire--as well as an exceptionally easy form of pigeon\\r\\nfor a man of my type and talents to pluck--I have, so to speak,\\r\\ntaken up my abode upon you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles looked at him and groaned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man continued, in a tone of gentle badinage. \"I love the\\r\\nplot-interest of the game,\" he said, \"and so does dear Jessie here.\\r\\nWe both of us adore it. As long as I find such good pickings upon\\r\\nyou, I certainly am not going to turn away from so valuable a\\r\\ncarcass, in order to batten myself, at considerable trouble, upon\\r\\nminor capitalists, out of whom it is difficult to extract a few\\r\\nhundreds. It may have puzzled you to guess why I fix upon you so\\r\\npersistently. Now you know, and understand. When a fluke finds a\\r\\nsheep that suits him, that fluke lives upon him. You are my host: I\\r\\nam your parasite. This coup has failed. But don\\'t flatter yourself\\r\\nfor a moment it will be the last one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why do you insult me by telling me all this?\" Sir Charles cried,\\r\\nwrithing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colonel waved his hand. It was small and white. \"Because I _love_\\r\\nthe game,\" he answered, with a relish; \"and also, because the more\\r\\nprepared you are beforehand, the greater credit and amusement is\\r\\nthere in besting you. Well, now, ta-ta once more! I am wasting\\r\\nvaluable time. I might be cheating somebody. I must be off at\\r\\nonce.... Take care of yourself, Wentworth. But I know you _will_.\\r\\nYou always do. Ten per cent _is_ more usual!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rowed away and left us. As the boat began to disappear round the\\r\\ncorner of the island, White Heather--so she looked--stood up in the\\r\\nstern and shouted aloud through her pretty hands to us. \"By-bye,\\r\\ndear Sir Charles!\" she cried. \"Do wrap the rug around you! I\\'ll\\r\\nsend the men to fetch you as soon as ever I possibly can. And thank\\r\\nyou so much for those lovely flowers!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boat rounded the crags. We were alone on the island. Charles\\r\\nflung himself on the bare rock in a wild access of despondency.\\r\\nHe is accustomed to luxury, and cannot get on without his padded\\r\\ncushions. As for myself, I climbed with some difficulty to the top\\r\\nof the cliff, landward, and tried to make signals of distress with\\r\\nmy handkerchief to some passer-by on the mainland. All in vain.\\r\\nCharles had dismissed the crofters on the estate; and, as the\\r\\nshooting-party that day was in an opposite direction, not a soul\\r\\nwas near to whom we could call for succour.\\r\\n\\r\\nI climbed down again to Charles. The evening came on slowly. Cries\\r\\nof sea-birds rang weird upon the water. Puffins and cormorants\\r\\ncircled round our heads in the gray of twilight. Charles suggested\\r\\nthat they might even swoop down upon us and bite us. They did not,\\r\\nhowever, but their flapping wings added none the less a painful\\r\\ntouch of eeriness to our hunger and solitude. Charles was horribly\\r\\ndepressed. For myself, I will confess I felt so much relieved at\\r\\nthe fact that Colonel Clay had not openly betrayed me in the matter\\r\\nof the commission, as to be comparatively comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe crouched on the hard crag. About eleven o\\'clock we heard human\\r\\nvoices. \"Boat ahoy!\" I shouted. An answering shout aroused us to\\r\\naction. We rushed down to the landing-place and cooee\\'d for the men,\\r\\nto show them where we were. They came up at once in Sir Charles\\'s\\r\\nown boat. They were fishermen from Niggarey, on the shore of the\\r\\nFirth opposite.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lady and gentleman had sent them, they said, to return the boat\\r\\nand call for us on the island; their description corresponded to\\r\\nthe two supposed Grantons. They rowed us home almost in silence to\\r\\nSeldon. It was half-past twelve by the gatehouse clock when we\\r\\nreached the castle. Men had been sent along the coast each way to\\r\\nseek us. Amelia had gone to bed, much alarmed for our safety. Isabel\\r\\nwas sitting up. It was too late, of course, to do much that night in\\r\\nthe way of apprehending the miscreants, though Charles insisted upon\\r\\ndispatching a groom, with a telegram for the police at Inverness,\\r\\nto Fowlis.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing came of it all. A message awaited us from Lord\\r\\nCraig-Ellachie, to be sure, saying that his son had not left\\r\\nGlen-Ellachie Lodge; while research the next day and later showed\\r\\nthat our correspondent had never even received our letter. An empty\\r\\nenvelope alone had arrived at the house, and the postal authorities\\r\\nhad been engaged meanwhile, with their usual lightning speed, in\\r\\n\"investigating the matter.\" C\\xc3\\xa9sarine had posted the letter herself\\r\\nat Fowlis, and brought back the receipt; so the only conclusion we\\r\\ncould draw was this--Colonel Clay must be in league with somebody\\r\\nat the post-office. As for Lord Craig-Ellachie\\'s reply, that was a\\r\\nsimple forgery; though, oddly enough, it was written on\\r\\nGlen-Ellachie paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, by the time Charles had eaten a couple of grouse, and\\r\\ndrunk a bottle of his excellent Rudesheimer, his spirits and valour\\r\\nrevived exceedingly. Doubtless he inherits from his Boer ancestry a\\r\\ntendency towards courage of the Batavian description. He was in\\r\\ncapital feather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"After all, Sey,\" he said, leaning back in his chair, \"this time\\r\\nwe score one. He has _not_ done us brown; we have at least detected\\r\\nhim. To detect him in time is half-way to catching him. Only the\\r\\nremoteness of our position at Seldon Castle saved him from capture.\\r\\nNext set-to, I feel sure, we will not merely spot him, we will also\\r\\nnab him. I only wish he would try on such a rig in London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the oddest part of it all was this, that from the moment those\\r\\ntwo people landed at Niggarey, and told the fishermen there were\\r\\nsome gentlemen stranded on the Seamew\\'s island, all trace of them\\r\\nvanished. At no station along the line could we gain any news of\\r\\nthem. Their maid had left the inn the same morning with their\\r\\nluggage, and we tracked her to Inverness; but there the trail\\r\\nstopped short, no spoor lay farther. It was a most singular and\\r\\ninsoluble mystery.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles lived in hopes of catching his man in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for my part, I felt there was a show of reason in one last\\r\\ntaunt which the rascal flung back at us as the boat receded: \"Sir\\r\\nCharles Vandrift, we are a pair of rogues. The law protects _you_.\\r\\nIt persecutes _me_. That\\'s all the difference.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE GERMAN PROFESSOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat winter in town my respected brother-in-law had little time\\r\\non his hands to bother himself about trifles like Colonel Clay.\\r\\nA thunderclap burst upon him. He saw his chief interest in South\\r\\nAfrica threatened by a serious, an unexpected, and a crushing\\r\\ndanger.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles does a little in gold, and a little in land; but his\\r\\nprincipal operations have always lain in the direction of diamonds.\\r\\nOnly once in my life, indeed, have I seen him pay the slightest\\r\\nattention to poetry, and that was when I happened one day to\\r\\nrecite the lines:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  Full many a gem of purest ray serene\\r\\n  The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rubbed his hands at once and murmured enthusiastically, \"I never\\r\\nthought of that. We might get up an Atlantic Exploration Syndicate,\\r\\nLimited.\" So attached is he to diamonds. You may gather, therefore,\\r\\nwhat a shock it was to that gigantic brain to learn that science was\\r\\nrapidly reaching a point where his favourite gems might become all\\r\\nat once a mere drug in the market. Depreciation is the one bugbear\\r\\nthat perpetually torments Sir Charles\\'s soul; that winter he stood\\r\\nwithin measurable distance of so appalling a calamity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened after this manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were strolling along Piccadilly towards Charles\\'s club one\\r\\nafternoon--he is a prominent member of the Croesus, in Pall\\r\\nMall--when, near Burlington House, whom should we happen to knock\\r\\nup against but Sir Adolphus Cordery, the famous mineralogist, and\\r\\nleading spirit of the Royal Society! He nodded to us pleasantly.\\r\\n\"Halloa, Vandrift,\" he cried, in his peculiarly loud and piercing\\r\\nvoice; \"you\\'re the very man I wanted to meet to-day. Good morning,\\r\\nWentworth. Well, how about diamonds now, Sir Gorgius? You\\'ll have to\\r\\nsing small. It\\'s all up with you Midases. Heard about this marvellous\\r\\nnew discovery of Schleiermacher\\'s? It\\'s calculated to make you\\r\\ndiamond kings squirm like an eel in a frying-pan.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see Charles wriggle inside his clothes. He was most\\r\\nuncomfortable. That a man like Cordery should say such things, in\\r\\nso loud a voice, on no matter how little foundation, openly in\\r\\nPiccadilly, was enough in itself to make a sensitive barometer\\r\\nsuch as Cloetedorp Golcondas go down a point or two.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush, hush!\" Charles said solemnly, in that awed tone of voice\\r\\nwhich he always assumes when Money is blasphemed against. \"_Please_\\r\\ndon\\'t talk quite so loud! All London can hear you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Adolphus ran his arm through Charles\\'s most amicably. There\\'s\\r\\nnothing Charles hates like having his arm taken.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come along with me to the Athen\\xc3\\xa6um,\" he went on, in the same\\r\\nstentorian voice, \"and I\\'ll tell you all about it. Most interesting\\r\\ndiscovery. Makes diamonds cheap as dirt. Calculated to supersede\\r\\nSouth Africa altogether.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles allowed himself to be dragged along. There was nothing else\\r\\npossible. Sir Adolphus continued, in a somewhat lower key, induced\\r\\nupon him by Charles\\'s mute look of protest. It was a disquieting\\r\\nstory. He told it with gleeful unction. It seems that Professor\\r\\nSchleiermacher, of Jena, \"the greatest living authority on the\\r\\nchemistry of gems,\" he said, had lately invented, or claimed to\\r\\nhave invented, a system for artificially producing diamonds, which\\r\\nhad yielded most surprising and unexceptionable results.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles\\'s lip curled slightly. \"Oh, I know the sort of thing,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"I\\'ve heard of it before. Very inferior stones, quite small\\r\\nand worthless, produced at immense cost, and even then not worth\\r\\nlooking at. I\\'m an old bird, you know, Cordery; not to be caught\\r\\nwith chaff. Tell me a better one!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Adolphus produced a small cut gem from his pocket. \"How\\'s that\\r\\nfor the first water?\" he inquired, passing it across, with a broad\\r\\nsmile, to the sceptic. \"Made under my own eyes--and quite\\r\\ninexpensively!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles examined it close, stopping short against the railings in\\r\\nSt. James\\'s Square to look at it with his pocket-lens. There was no\\r\\ndenying the truth. It was a capital small gem of the finest quality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Made under your own eyes?\" he exclaimed, still incredulous. \"Where,\\r\\nmy dear sir?--at Jena?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer was a thunderbolt from a blue sky. \"No, here in London;\\r\\nlast night as ever was; before myself and Dr. Gray; and about to be\\r\\nexhibited by the President himself at a meeting of Fellows of the\\r\\nRoyal Society.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles drew a long breath. \"This nonsense must be stopped,\" he said\\r\\nfirmly--\"it must be nipped in the bud. It won\\'t do, my dear friend;\\r\\nwe can\\'t have such tampering with important Interests.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How do you mean?\" Cordery asked, astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles gazed at him steadily. I could see by the furtive gleam in\\r\\nmy brother-in-law\\'s eye he was distinctly frightened. \"Where _is_\\r\\nthe fellow?\" he asked. \"Did he come himself, or send over a deputy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here in London,\" Sir Adolphus replied. \"He\\'s staying at my house;\\r\\nand he says he\\'ll be glad to show his experiments to anybody\\r\\nscientifically interested in diamonds. We propose to have a\\r\\ndemonstration of the process to-night at Lancaster Gate. Will\\r\\nyou drop in and see it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWould he \"drop in\" and see it? \"Drop in\" at such a function! Could\\r\\nhe possibly stop away? Charles clutched the enemy\\'s arm with a\\r\\nnervous grip. \"Look here, Cordery,\" he said, quivering; \"this is a\\r\\nquestion affecting very important Interests. Don\\'t do anything rash.\\r\\nDon\\'t do anything foolish. Remember that Shares may rise or fall on\\r\\nthis.\" He said \"Shares\" in a tone of profound respect that I can\\r\\nhardly even indicate. It was the crucial word in the creed of his\\r\\nreligion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I should think it very probable,\" Sir Adolphus replied, with the\\r\\ncallous indifference of the mere man of science to financial\\r\\nsuffering.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Charles was bland, but peremptory. \"Now, observe,\" he said, \"a\\r\\ngrave responsibility rests on your shoulders. The Market depends\\r\\nupon you. You must not ask in any number of outsiders to witness\\r\\nthese experiments. Have a few mineralogists and experts, if you\\r\\nlike; but also take care to invite representatives of the menaced\\r\\nInterests. I will come myself--I\\'m engaged to dine out, but I\\r\\ncan contract an indisposition; and I should advise you to ask\\r\\nMosenheimer, and, say, young Phipson. They would stand for the\\r\\nmines, as you and the mineralogists would stand for science. Above\\r\\nall, don\\'t blab; for Heaven\\'s sake, let there be no premature\\r\\ngossip. Tell Schleiermacher not to go gassing and boasting of\\r\\nhis success all over London.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are keeping the matter a profound secret, at Schleiermacher\\'s\\r\\nown request,\" Cordery answered, more seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Which is why,\" Charles said, in his severest tone, \"you bawled it\\r\\nout at the very top of your voice in Piccadilly!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, before nightfall, everything was arranged to Charles\\'s\\r\\nsatisfaction; and off we went to Lancaster Gate, with a profound\\r\\nexpectation that the German professor would do nothing worth seeing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a remarkable-looking man, once tall, I should say, from his\\r\\nlong, thin build, but now bowed and bent with long devotion to study\\r\\nand leaning over a crucible. His hair, prematurely white, hung down\\r\\nupon his forehead, but his eye was keen and his mouth sagacious. He\\r\\nshook hands cordially with the men of science, whom he seemed to\\r\\nknow of old, whilst he bowed somewhat distantly to the South African\\r\\ninterest. Then he began to talk, in very German-English, helping out\\r\\nthe sense now and again, where his vocabulary failed him, by waving\\r\\nhis rather dirty and chemical-stained hands demonstratively about\\r\\nhim. His nails were a sight, but his fingers, I must say, had the\\r\\ndelicate shape of a man\\'s accustomed to minute manipulation. He\\r\\nplunged at once into the thick of the matter, telling us briefly in\\r\\nhis equally thick accent that he \"now brobosed by his new brocess\\r\\nto make for us some goot and sadisfactory tiamonds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brought out his apparatus, and explained--or, as he said,\\r\\n\"eggsblained\"--his novel method. \"Tiamonds,\" he said, \"were nozzing\\r\\nbut pure crystalline carbon.\" He knew how to crystallise it--\"zat\\r\\nwas all ze secret.\" The men of science examined the pots and pans\\r\\ncarefully. Then he put in a certain number of raw materials, and\\r\\nwent to work with ostentatious openness. There were three distinct\\r\\nprocesses, and he made two stones by each simultaneously. The\\r\\nremarkable part of his methods, he said, was their rapidity and\\r\\ntheir cheapness. In three-quarters of an hour (and he smiled\\r\\nsardonically) he could produce a diamond worth at current prices\\r\\ntwo hundred pounds sterling. \"As you shall now see me berform,\"\\r\\nhe remarked, \"viz zis simple abbaradus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe materials fizzed and fumed. The Professor stirred them. An\\r\\nunpleasant smell like burnt feathers pervaded the room. The\\r\\nscientific men craned their necks in their eagerness, and looked\\r\\nover one another; Vane-Vivian, in particular, was all attention.\\r\\nAfter three-quarters of an hour, the Professor, still smiling, began\\r\\nto empty the apparatus. He removed a large quantity of dust or\\r\\npowder, which he succinctly described as \"by-broducts,\" and then\\r\\ntook between finger and thumb from the midst of each pan a small\\r\\nwhite pebble, not water-worn apparently, but slightly rough and\\r\\nwart-like on the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom one pair of the pannikins he produced two such stones, and\\r\\nheld them up before us triumphantly. \"Zese,\" he said, \"are genuine\\r\\ntiamonds, manufactured at a gost of fourteen shillings and\\r\\nsiggspence abiece!\" Then he tried the second pair. \"Zese,\" he said,\\r\\nstill more gleefully, \"are broduced at a gost of eleffen and\\r\\nninebence!\" Finally, he came to the third pair, which he positively\\r\\nbrandished before our astonished eyes. \"And zese,\" he cried,\\r\\ntransported, \"haff gost me no more zan tree and eightbence!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were handed round for inspection. Rough and uncut as they\\r\\nstood, it was, of course, impossible to judge of their value. But\\r\\none thing was certain. The men of science had been watching close at\\r\\nthe first, and were sure Herr Schleiermacher had not put the stones\\r\\nin; they were keen at the withdrawal, and were equally sure he had\\r\\ntaken them honestly out of the pannikins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I vill now disdribute zem,\" the Professor remarked in a casual\\r\\ntone, as if diamonds were peas, looking round at the company. And\\r\\nhe singled out my brother-in-law. \"One to Sir Charles!\" he said,\\r\\nhanding it; \"one to Mr. Mosenheimer; one to Mr. Phibson--as\\r\\nrepresenting the tiamond interest. Zen, one each to Sir Atolphus,\\r\\nto Dr. Gray, to Mr. Fane-Fiffian, as representing science. You will\\r\\nhaff zem cut and rebort upon zem in due gourse. We meet again at\\r\\nzis blace ze day afder do-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles gazed at him reproachfully. The profoundest chords of his\\r\\nmoral nature were stirred. \"Professor,\" he said, in a voice of\\r\\nsolemn warning, \"_Are_ you aware that, _if_ you have succeeded, you\\r\\nhave destroyed the value of thousands of pounds\\' worth of precious\\r\\nproperty?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Professor shrugged his shoulders. \"Fot is dat to me?\" he\\r\\ninquired, with a curious glance of contempt. \"I am not a financier!\\r\\nI am a man of science. I seek to know; I do not seek to make a\\r\\nfortune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shocking!\" Charles exclaimed. \"Shocking! I never before in my life\\r\\nbeheld so strange an instance of complete insensibility to the\\r\\nclaims of others!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe separated early. The men of science were coarsely jubilant. The\\r\\ndiamond interest exhibited a corresponding depression. If this news\\r\\nwere true, they foresaw a slump. Every eye grew dim. It was a\\r\\nterrible business.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles walked homeward with the Professor. He sounded him gently as\\r\\nto the sum required, should need arise, to purchase his secrecy.\\r\\nAlready Sir Adolphus had bound us all down to temporary silence--as\\r\\nif that were necessary; but Charles wished to know how much\\r\\nSchleiermacher would take to suppress his discovery. The German\\r\\nwas immovable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no!\" he replied, with positive petulance. \"You do not\\r\\nunterstant. I do not buy and sell. Zis is a chemical fact. We must\\r\\nbublish it for the sake off its seoretical falue. I do not care\\r\\nfor wealse. I haff no time to waste in making money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What an awful picture of a misspent life!\" Charles observed to me\\r\\nafterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, indeed, the man seemed to care for nothing on earth but the\\r\\nabstract question--not whether he could make good diamonds or not,\\r\\nbut whether he could or could not produce a crystalline form of\\r\\npure carbon!\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the appointed night Charles went back to Lancaster Gate, as I\\r\\ncould not fail to remark, with a strange air of complete and painful\\r\\npreoccupation. Never before in his life had I seen him so anxious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe diamonds were produced, with one surface of each slightly scored\\r\\nby the cutters, so as to show the water. Then a curious result\\r\\ndisclosed itself. Strange to say, each of the three diamonds given\\r\\nto the three diamond kings turned out to be a most inferior and\\r\\nvalueless stone; while each of the three intrusted to the care of\\r\\nthe scientific investigators turned out to be a fine gem of the\\r\\npurest quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nI confess it was a sufficiently suspicious conjunction. The three\\r\\nrepresentatives of the diamond interest gazed at each other with\\r\\ninquiring side-glances. Then their eyes fell suddenly: they avoided\\r\\none another. Had each independently substituted a weak and inferior\\r\\nnatural stone for Professor Schleiermacher\\'s manufactured pebbles?\\r\\nIt almost seemed so. For a moment, I admit, I was half inclined to\\r\\nsuppose it. But next second I changed my mind. Could a man of Sir\\r\\nCharles Vandrift\\'s integrity and high principle stoop for lucre\\'s\\r\\nsake to so mean an expedient?--not to mention the fact that, even if\\r\\nhe did, and if Mosenheimer did likewise, the stones submitted to the\\r\\nscientific men would have amply sufficed to establish the reality\\r\\nand success of the experiments!\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, I must say, Charles looked guiltily across at Mosenheimer,\\r\\nand Mosenheimer at Phipson, while three more uncomfortable or\\r\\nunhappy-faced men could hardly have been found at that precise\\r\\nminute in the City of Westminster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Sir Adolphus spoke--or, rather, he orated. He said, in his loud\\r\\nand grating voice, we had that evening, and on a previous evening,\\r\\nbeen present at the conception and birth of an Epoch in the History\\r\\nof Science. Professor Schleiermacher was one of those men of whom\\r\\nhis native Saxony might well be proud; while as a Briton he must\\r\\nsay he regretted somewhat that this discovery, like so many\\r\\nothers, should have been \"Made in Germany.\" However, Professor\\r\\nSchleiermacher was a specimen of that noble type of scientific men\\r\\nto whom gold was merely the rare metal Au, and diamonds merely the\\r\\nelement C in the scarcest of its manifold allotropic embodiments.\\r\\nThe Professor did not seek to make money out of his discovery. He\\r\\nrose above the sordid greed of capitalists. Content with the glory\\r\\nof having traced the element C to its crystalline origin, he asked\\r\\nno more than the approval of science. However, out of deference to\\r\\nthe wishes of those financial gentlemen who were oddly concerned in\\r\\nmaintaining the present price of C in its crystalline form--in other\\r\\nwords, the diamond interest--they had arranged that the secret\\r\\nshould be strictly guarded and kept for the present; not one of the\\r\\nfew persons admitted to the experiments would publicly divulge the\\r\\ntruth about them. This secrecy would be maintained till he himself,\\r\\nand a small committee of the Royal Society, should have time to\\r\\ninvestigate and verify for themselves the Professor\\'s beautiful\\r\\nand ingenious processes--an investigation and verification which\\r\\nthe learned Professor himself both desired and suggested.\\r\\n(Schleiermacher nodded approval.) When that was done, if the\\r\\nprocess stood the test, further concealment would be absolutely\\r\\nfutile. The price of diamonds must fall at once below that of paste,\\r\\nand any protest on the part of the financial world would, of course,\\r\\nbe useless. The laws of Nature were superior to millionaires.\\r\\nMeanwhile, in deference to the opinion of Sir Charles Vandrift,\\r\\nwhose acquaintance with that fascinating side of the subject nobody\\r\\ncould deny, they had consented to send no notices to the Press, and\\r\\nto abstain from saying anything about this beautiful and simple\\r\\nprocess in public. He dwelt with horrid gusto on that epithet\\r\\n\"beautiful.\" And now, in the name of British mineralogy, he must\\r\\ncongratulate Professor Schleiermacher, our distinguished guest, on\\r\\nhis truly brilliant and crystalline contribution to our knowledge\\r\\nof brilliants and of crystalline science.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody applauded. It was an awkward moment. Sir Charles bit his\\r\\nlip. Mosenheimer looked glum. Young Phipson dropped an expression\\r\\nwhich I will not transcribe. (I understand this work may circulate\\r\\namong families.) And after a solemn promise of death-like secrecy,\\r\\nthe meeting separated.\\r\\n\\r\\nI noticed that my brother-in-law somewhat ostentatiously avoided\\r\\nMosenheimer at the door; and that Phipson jumped quickly into his\\r\\nown carriage. \"Home!\" Charles cried gloomily to the coachman as we\\r\\ntook our seats in the brougham. And all the way to Mayfair he leaned\\r\\nback in his seat, with close-set lips, never uttering a syllable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore he retired to rest, however, in the privacy of the\\r\\nbilliard-room, I ventured to ask him: \"Charles, will you unload\\r\\nGolcondas to-morrow?\" Which, I need hardly explain, is the slang of\\r\\nthe Stock Exchange for getting rid of undesirable securities. It\\r\\nstruck me as probable that, in the event of the invention turning\\r\\nout a reality, Cloetedorp A\\'s might become unsaleable within the\\r\\nnext few weeks or so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe eyed me sternly. \"Wentworth,\" he said, \"you\\'re a fool!\" (Except\\r\\non occasions when he is _very_ angry, my respected connection\\r\\n_never_ calls me \"Wentworth\"; the familiar abbreviation,\\r\\n\"Sey\"--derived from Seymour--is his usual mode of address to\\r\\nme in private.) \"_Is_ it likely I would unload, and wreck the\\r\\nconfidence of the public in the Cloetedorp Company at such a\\r\\nmoment? As a director--as Chairman--would it be just or right of\\r\\nme? I ask you, sir, _could_ I reconcile it to my conscience?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Charles,\" I answered, \"you are right. Your conduct is noble. You\\r\\nwill not save your own personal interests at the expense of those\\r\\nwho have put their trust in you. Such probity is, alas! very rare in\\r\\nfinance!\" And I sighed involuntarily; for I had lost in Liberators.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time I thought to myself, \"_I_ am not a director. No\\r\\ntrust is reposed in _me_. _I_ have to think first of dear Isabel and\\r\\nthe baby. Before the crash comes _I_ will sell out to-morrow the\\r\\nfew shares I hold, through Charles\\'s kindness, in the Cloetedorp\\r\\nGolcondas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith his marvellous business instinct, Charles seemed to divine\\r\\nmy thought, for he turned round to me sharply. \"Look here, Sey,\"\\r\\nhe remarked, in an acidulous tone, \"recollect, you\\'re my\\r\\nbrother-in-law. You are also my secretary. The eyes of London will\\r\\nbe upon us to-morrow. If _you_ were to sell out, and operators got to\\r\\nknow of it, they\\'d suspect there was something up, and the company\\r\\nwould suffer for it. Of course, you can do what you like with your\\r\\nown property. I can\\'t interfere with _that_. I do not dictate to\\r\\nyou. But as Chairman of the Golcondas, I am bound to see that the\\r\\ninterests of widows and orphans whose All is invested with me should\\r\\nnot suffer at this crisis.\" His voice seemed to falter. \"Therefore,\\r\\nthough I don\\'t like to threaten,\" he went on, \"I am bound to give\\r\\nyou warning: _if_ you sell out those shares of yours, openly or\\r\\nsecretly, you are no longer my secretary; you receive forthwith six\\r\\nmonths\\' salary in lieu of notice, and--you leave me instantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very well, Charles,\" I answered, in a submissive voice; though I\\r\\ndebated with myself for a moment whether it would be best to stick\\r\\nto the ready money and quit the sinking ship, or to hold fast by my\\r\\nfriend, and back Charles\\'s luck against the Professor\\'s science.\\r\\nAfter a short, sharp struggle within my own mind, I am proud to say,\\r\\nfriendship and gratitude won. I felt sure that, whether diamonds\\r\\nwent up or down, Charles Vandrift was the sort of man who would come\\r\\nto the top in the end in spite of everything. And I decided to stand\\r\\nby him!\\r\\n\\r\\nI slept little that night, however. My mind was a whirlwind. At\\r\\nbreakfast Charles also looked haggard and moody. He ordered the\\r\\ncarriage early, and drove straight into the City.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a block in Cheapside. Charles, impatient and nervous,\\r\\njumped out and walked. I walked beside him. Near Wood Street a man\\r\\nwe knew casually stopped us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I think I ought to mention to you,\" he said, confidentially,\\r\\n\"that I have it on the very best authority that Schleiermacher,\\r\\nof Jena--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you,\" Charles said, crustily, \"I know that tale, and--there\\'s\\r\\nnot a word of truth in it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brushed on in haste. A yard or two farther a broker paused in\\r\\nfront of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Halloa, Sir Charles!\" he called out, in a bantering tone. \"What\\'s\\r\\nall this about diamonds? Where are Cloetedorps to-day? Is it\\r\\nGolconda, or Queer Street?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles drew himself up very stiff. \"I fail to understand you,\"\\r\\nhe answered, with dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, you were there yourself,\" the man cried. \"Last night at Sir\\r\\nAdolphus\\'s! Oh yes, it\\'s all over the place; Schleiermacher of Jena\\r\\nhas succeeded in making the most perfect diamonds--for sixpence\\r\\napiece--as good as real--and South Africa\\'s ancient history. In less\\r\\nthan six weeks Kimberley, they say, will be a howling desert. Every\\r\\ncostermonger in Whitechapel will wear genuine Koh-i-noors for\\r\\nbuttons on his coat; every girl in Bermondsey will sport a rivi\\xc3\\xa8re\\r\\nlike Lady Vandrift\\'s to her favourite music-hall. There\\'s a slump\\r\\nin Golcondas. Sly, sly, I can see; but _we_ know all about it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles moved on, disgusted. The man\\'s manners were atrocious.\\r\\nNear the Bank we ran up against a most respectable jobber.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, Sir Charles,\" he said; \"you here? Well, this is strange news,\\r\\nisn\\'t it? For my part, I advise you not to take it too seriously.\\r\\nYour stock will go down, of course, like lead this morning. But\\r\\nit\\'ll rise to-morrow, mark my words, and fluctuate every hour till\\r\\nthe discovery\\'s proved or disproved for certain. There\\'s a fine\\r\\ntime coming for operators, I feel sure. Reports this way and that.\\r\\nRumours, rumours, rumours. And nobody will know which way to believe\\r\\ntill Sir Adolphus has tested it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe moved on towards the House. Black care was seated on Sir\\r\\nCharles\\'s shoulders. As we drew nearer and nearer, everybody was\\r\\ndiscussing the one fact of the moment. The seal of secrecy had\\r\\nproved more potent than publication on the housetops. Some people\\r\\ntold us of the exciting news in confidential whispers; some\\r\\nproclaimed it aloud in vulgar exultation. The general opinion was\\r\\nthat Cloetedorps were doomed, and that the sooner a man cleared\\r\\nout the less was he likely to lose by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles strode on like a general; but it was a Napoleon brazening\\r\\nout his retreat from Moscow. His mien was resolute. He disappeared\\r\\nat last into the precincts of an office, waving me back, not to\\r\\nfollow. After a long consultation he came out and rejoined me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day long the City rang with Golcondas, Golcondas. Everybody\\r\\nmurmured, \"Slump, slump in Golcondas.\" The brokers had more business\\r\\nto do than they could manage; though, to be sure, almost every one\\r\\nwas a seller and no one a buyer. But Charles stood firm as a rock,\\r\\nand so did his brokers. \"I don\\'t want to sell,\" he said, doggedly.\\r\\n\"The whole thing is trumped up. It\\'s a mere piece of jugglery. For\\r\\nmy own part, I believe Professor Schleiermacher is deceived, or else\\r\\nis deceiving us. In another week the bubble will have burst, and\\r\\nprices will restore themselves.\" His brokers, Finglemores, had only\\r\\none answer to all inquiries: \"Sir Charles has every confidence in\\r\\nthe stability of Golcondas, and doesn\\'t wish to sell or to increase\\r\\nthe panic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the world said he was splendid, splendid! There he stationed\\r\\nhimself on \\'Change like some granite stack against which the waves\\r\\nroll and break themselves in vain. He took no notice of the slump,\\r\\nbut ostentatiously bought up a few shares here and there so as to\\r\\nrestore public confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I would buy more,\" he said, freely, \"and make my fortune; only,\\r\\nas I was one of those who happened to spend last night at Sir\\r\\nAdolphus\\'s, people might think I had helped to spread the rumour\\r\\nand produce the slump, in order to buy in at panic rates for my\\r\\nown advantage. A chairman, like Caesar\\'s wife, should be above\\r\\nsuspicion. So I shall only buy up just enough, now and again, to\\r\\nlet people see I, at least, have no doubt as to the firm future\\r\\nof Cloetedorps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went home that night, more harassed and ill than I have ever\\r\\nseen him. Next day was as bad. The slump continued, with varying\\r\\nepisodes. Now, a rumour would surge up that Sir Adolphus had\\r\\ndeclared the whole affair a sham, and prices would steady a little;\\r\\nnow, another would break out that the diamonds were actually being\\r\\nput upon the market in Berlin by the cart-load, and timid old ladies\\r\\nwould wire down to their brokers to realise off-hand at whatever\\r\\nhazard. It was an awful day. I shall never forget it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning after, as if by miracle, things righted themselves of\\r\\na sudden. While we were wondering what it meant, Charles received a\\r\\ntelegram from Sir Adolphus Cordery:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The man is a fraud. Not Schleiermacher at all. Just had a wire\\r\\nfrom Jena saying the Professor knows nothing about him. Sorry\\r\\nunintentionally to have caused you trouble. Come round and see me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sorry unintentionally to have caused you trouble.\" Charles was\\r\\nbeside himself with anger. Sir Adolphus had upset the share-market\\r\\nfor forty-eight mortal hours, half-ruined a round dozen of wealthy\\r\\noperators, convulsed the City, upheaved the House, and now--he\\r\\napologised for it as one might apologise for being late ten minutes\\r\\nfor dinner! Charles jumped into a hansom and rushed round to see\\r\\nhim. How had he dared to introduce the impostor to solid men as\\r\\nProfessor Schleiermacher? Sir Adolphus shrugged his shoulders. The\\r\\nfellow had come and introduced himself as the great Jena chemist;\\r\\nhe had long white hair, and a stoop in the shoulders. What reason\\r\\nhad _he_ for doubting his word? (I reflected to myself that on much\\r\\nthe same grounds Charles in turn had accepted the Honourable David\\r\\nGranton and Graf von Lebenstein.) Besides, what object could the\\r\\ncreature have for this extraordinary deception? Charles knew only\\r\\ntoo well. It was clear it was done to disturb the diamond market,\\r\\nand we realised, too late, that the man who had done it was--Colonel\\r\\nClay, in \"another of his manifold allotropic embodiments!\" Charles\\r\\nhad had his wish, and had met his enemy once more in London!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe could see the whole plot. Colonel Clay was polymorphic, like the\\r\\nelement carbon! Doubtless, with his extraordinary sleight of hand,\\r\\nhe had substituted real diamonds for the shapeless mass that came\\r\\nout of the apparatus, in the interval between handing the pebbles\\r\\nround for inspection, and distributing them piecemeal to the men of\\r\\nscience and representatives of the diamond interest. We all watched\\r\\nhim closely, of course, when he opened the crucibles; but when once\\r\\nwe had satisfied ourselves that _something_ came out, our doubts were\\r\\nset at rest, and we forgot to watch whether he distributed those\\r\\nsomethings or not to the recipients. Conjurers always depend upon\\r\\nsuch momentary distractions or lapses of attention. As usual, too,\\r\\nthe Professor had disappeared into space the moment his trick was\\r\\nonce well performed. He vanished like smoke, as the Count and Seer\\r\\nhad vanished before, and was never again heard of.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles went home more angry than I have ever beheld him. I couldn\\'t\\r\\nimagine why. He seemed as deeply hipped as if he had lost his\\r\\nthousands. I endeavoured to console him. \"After all,\" I said,\\r\\n\"though Golcondas have suffered a temporary loss, it\\'s a comfort\\r\\nto think that you should have stood so firm, and not only stemmed\\r\\nthe tide, but also prevented yourself from losing anything at all\\r\\nof your own through panic. I\\'m sorry, of course, for the widows\\r\\nand orphans; but if Colonel Clay has rigged the market, at least\\r\\nit isn\\'t YOU who lose by it this time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles withered me with a fierce scowl of undisguised contempt.\\r\\n\"Wentworth,\" he said once more, \"you are a fool!\" Then he relapsed\\r\\ninto silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But you declined to sell out,\" I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gazed at me fixedly. \"Is it likely,\" he asked at last, \"I would\\r\\ntell _you_ if I meant to sell out? or that I\\'d sell out openly through\\r\\nFinglemore, my usual broker? Why, all the world would have known,\\r\\nand Golcondas would have been finished. As it is, I don\\'t desire to\\r\\ntell an ass like you exactly how much I\\'ve lost. But I _did_ sell out,\\r\\nand some unknown operator bought in at once, and closed for ready\\r\\nmoney, and has sold again this morning; and after all that has\\r\\nhappened, it will be impossible to track him. He didn\\'t wait for the\\r\\naccount: he settled up instantly. And he sold in like manner. I know\\r\\nnow what has been done, and how cleverly it has all been disguised\\r\\nand covered; but the most I\\'m going to tell you to-day is just\\r\\nthis--it\\'s by far the biggest haul Colonel Clay has made out of me.\\r\\nHe could retire on it if he liked. My one hope is, it may satisfy\\r\\nhim for life; but, then, no man has ever had enough of making money.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_You_ sold out!\" I exclaimed. \"_You_, the Chairman of the company!\\r\\n_You_ deserted the ship! And how about your trust? How about the widows\\r\\nand orphans confided to you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles rose and faced me. \"Seymour Wentworth,\" he said, in his most\\r\\nsolemn voice, \"you have lived with me for years and had every\\r\\nadvantage. You have seen high finance. Yet you ask me that question!\\r\\nIt\\'s my belief you will never, never understand business!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE ARREST OF THE COLONEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow much precisely Charles dropped over the slump in Cloetedorps\\r\\nI never quite knew. But the incident left him dejected, limp, and\\r\\ndispirited.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hang it all, Sey,\" he said to me in the smoking-room, a few\\r\\nevenings later. \"This Colonel Clay is enough to vex the patience of\\r\\nJob--and Job had large losses, too, if I recollect aright, from the\\r\\nChaldeans and other big operators of the period.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Three thousand camels,\" I murmured, recalling my dear mother\\'s\\r\\nlessons; \"all at one fell swoop; not to mention five hundred yoke of\\r\\noxen, carried off by the Sabeans, then a leading firm of speculative\\r\\ncattle-dealers!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, well,\" Charles meditated aloud, shaking the ash from his\\r\\ncheroot into a Japanese tray--fine antique bronze-work. \"There were\\r\\nbig transactions in live-stock even then! Still, Job or no Job, the\\r\\nman is too much for me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The difficulty is,\" I assented, \"you never know where to have him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" Charles mused; \"if he were always the same, like Horniman\\'s\\r\\ntea or a good brand of whisky, it would be easier, of course; you\\'d\\r\\nstand some chance of spotting him. But when a man turns up smiling\\r\\nevery time in a different disguise, which fits him like a skin, and\\r\\nalways apparently with the best credentials, why, hang it all, Sey,\\r\\nthere\\'s no wrestling with him anyhow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who could have come to us, for example, better vouched,\" I\\r\\nacquiesced, \"than the Honourable David?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly so,\" Charles murmured. \"I invited him myself, for my own\\r\\nadvantage. And he arrived with all the prestige of the Glen-Ellachie\\r\\nconnection.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or the Professor?\" I went on. \"Introduced to us by the leading\\r\\nmineralogist of England.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI had touched a sore point. Charles winced and remained silent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then, women again,\" he resumed, after a painful pause. \"I must meet\\r\\nin society many charming women. I can\\'t everywhere and always be on\\r\\nmy guard against every dear soul of them. Yet the moment I relax\\r\\nmy attention for one day--or even when I don\\'t relax it--I am\\r\\nbamboozled and led a dance by that arch Mme. Picardet, or that\\r\\ntransparently simple little minx, Mrs. Granton. She\\'s the cleverest\\r\\ngirl I ever met in my life, that hussy, whatever we\\'re to call her.\\r\\nShe\\'s a different person each time; and each time, hang it all, I\\r\\nlose my heart afresh to that different person.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI glanced round to make sure Amelia was well out of earshot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Sey,\" my respected connection went on, after another long\\r\\npause, sipping his coffee pensively, \"I feel I must be aided in this\\r\\nsuperhuman task by a professional unraveller of cunning disguises. I\\r\\nshall go to Marvillier\\'s to-morrow--fortunate man, Marvillier--and\\r\\nask him to supply me with a really good \\'tec, who will stop in the\\r\\nhouse and keep an eye upon every living soul that comes near me.\\r\\nHe shall scan each nose, each eye, each wig, each whisker. He shall\\r\\nbe my watchful half, my unsleeping self; it shall be his business\\r\\nto suspect all living men, all breathing women. The Archbishop of\\r\\nCanterbury shall not escape for a moment his watchful regard; he\\r\\nwill take care that royal princesses don\\'t collar the spoons or walk\\r\\noff with the jewel-cases. He must see possible Colonel Clays in the\\r\\nguard of every train and the parson of every parish; he must detect\\r\\nthe off-chance of a Mme. Picardet in every young girl that takes tea\\r\\nwith Amelia, every fat old lady that comes to call upon Isabel. Yes,\\r\\nI have made my mind up. I shall go to-morrow and secure such a man\\r\\nat once at Marvillier\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you please, Sir Charles,\" C\\xc3\\xa9sarine interposed, pushing her head\\r\\nthrough the porti\\xc3\\xa8re, \"her ladyship says, will you and Mr. Wentworth\\r\\nremember that she goes out with you both this evening to Lady\\r\\nCarisbrooke\\'s?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bless my soul,\" Charles cried, \"so she does! And it\\'s now past ten!\\r\\nThe carriage will be at the door for us in another five minutes!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, accordingly, Charles drove round to Marvillier\\'s. The\\r\\nfamous detective listened to his story with glistening eyes; then he\\r\\nrubbed his hands and purred. \"Colonel Clay!\" he said; \"Colonel Clay!\\r\\nThat\\'s a very tough customer! The police of Europe are on the\\r\\nlook-out for Colonel Clay. He is wanted in London, in Paris, in\\r\\nBerlin. It is le Colonel Caoutchouc here, le Colonel Caoutchouc\\r\\nthere; till one begins to ask, at last, IS there _any_ Colonel\\r\\nCaoutchouc, or is it a convenient class name invented by the Force\\r\\nto cover a gang of undiscovered sharpers? However, Sir Charles, we\\r\\nwill do our best. I will set on the track without delay the best and\\r\\ncleverest detective in England.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The very man I want,\" Charles said. \"What name, Marvillier?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal smiled. \"Whatever name you like,\" he said. \"He isn\\'t\\r\\nparticular. Medhurst he\\'s called at home. _We_ call him Joe. I\\'ll\\r\\nsend him round to your house this afternoon for certain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh no,\" Charles said promptly, \"you won\\'t; or Colonel Clay himself\\r\\nwill come instead of him. I\\'ve been sold too often. No casual\\r\\nstrangers! I\\'ll wait here and see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he isn\\'t in,\" Marvillier objected.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was firm as a rock. \"Then send and fetch him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn half an hour, sure enough, the detective arrived. He was an\\r\\nodd-looking small man, with hair cut short and standing straight up\\r\\nall over his head, like a Parisian waiter. He had quick, sharp eyes,\\r\\nvery much like a ferret\\'s; his nose was depressed, his lips thin and\\r\\nbloodless. A scar marked his left cheek--made by a sword-cut, he\\r\\nsaid, when engaged one day in arresting a desperate French smuggler,\\r\\ndisguised as an officer of Chasseurs d\\'Afrique. His mien was\\r\\nresolute. Altogether, a quainter or \\'cuter little man it has never\\r\\nyet been my lot to set eyes on. He walked in with a brisk step,\\r\\neyed Charles up and down, and then, without much formality, asked\\r\\nfor what he was wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is Sir Charles Vandrift, the great diamond king,\" Marvillier\\r\\nsaid, introducing us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I see,\" the man answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then you know me?\" Charles asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wouldn\\'t be worth much,\" the detective replied, \"if I didn\\'t\\r\\nknow everybody. And you\\'re easy enough to know; why, every boy in\\r\\nthe street knows you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Plain spoken!\" Charles remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"As you like it, sir,\" the man answered in a respectful tone. \"I\\r\\nendeavour to suit my dress and behaviour on every occasion to the\\r\\ntaste of my employers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your name?\" Charles asked, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Joseph Medhurst, at your service. What sort of work? Stolen\\r\\ndiamonds? Illicit diamond-buying?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" Charles answered, fixing him with his eye. \"Quite another kind\\r\\nof job. You\\'ve heard of Colonel Clay?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMedhurst nodded. \"Why, certainly,\" he said; and, for the first time,\\r\\nI detected a lingering trace of American accent. \"It\\'s my business\\r\\nto know about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I want you to catch him,\" Charles went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedhurst drew a long breath. \"Isn\\'t that rather a large order?\"\\r\\nhe murmured, surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles explained to him exactly the sort of services he required.\\r\\nMedhurst promised to comply. \"If the man comes near you, I\\'ll spot\\r\\nhim,\" he said, after a moment\\'s pause. \"I can promise you that much.\\r\\nI\\'ll pierce any disguise. I should know in a minute whether he\\'s\\r\\ngot up or not. I\\'m death on wigs, false moustaches, artificial\\r\\ncomplexions. I\\'ll engage to bring the rogue to book if I see him.\\r\\nYou may set your mind at rest, that, while _I\\'m_ about you, Colonel\\r\\nClay can do nothing without my instantly spotting him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll do it,\" Marvillier put in. \"He\\'ll do it, if he says it. He\\'s\\r\\nmy very best hand. Never knew any man like him for unravelling and\\r\\nunmasking the cleverest disguises.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then he\\'ll suit me,\" Charles answered, \"for _I_ never knew any man\\r\\nlike Colonel Clay for assuming and maintaining them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was arranged accordingly that Medhurst should take up his\\r\\nresidence in the house for the present, and should be described to\\r\\nthe servants as assistant secretary. He came that very day, with a\\r\\nmarvellously small portmanteau. But from the moment he arrived,\\r\\nwe noticed that C\\xc3\\xa9sarine took a violent dislike to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedhurst was a most efficient detective. Charles and I told him\\r\\nall we knew about the various shapes in which Colonel Clay had\\r\\n\"materialised,\" and he gave us in turn many valuable criticisms and\\r\\nsuggestions. Why, when we began to suspect the Honourable David\\r\\nGranton, had we not, as if by accident, tried to knock his red wig\\r\\noff? Why, when the Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon first discussed\\r\\nthe question of the paste diamonds, had we not looked to see if\\r\\nany of Amelia\\'s unique gems were missing? Why, when Professor\\r\\nSchleiermacher made his bow to assembled science at Lancaster Gate,\\r\\nhad we not strictly inquired how far he was personally known\\r\\nbeforehand to Sir Adolphus Cordery and the other mineralogists?\\r\\nHe supplied us also with several good hints about false hair and\\r\\nmake-up; such as that Schleiermacher was probably much shorter than\\r\\nhe looked, but by imitating a stoop with padding at his back he\\r\\nhad produced the illusion of a tall bent man, though in reality no\\r\\nbigger than the little curate or the Graf von Lebenstein. High heels\\r\\ndid the rest; while the scientific keenness we noted in his face was\\r\\ndoubtless brought about by a trifle of wax at the end of the nose,\\r\\ngiving a peculiar tilt that is extremely effective. In short, I must\\r\\nfrankly admit, Medhurst made us feel ashamed of ourselves. Sharp as\\r\\nCharles is, we realised at once he was nowhere in observation beside\\r\\nthe trained and experienced senses of this professional detective.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst of it all was, while Medhurst was with us, by some curious\\r\\nfatality, Colonel Clay stopped away from us. Now and again, to be\\r\\nsure, we ran up against somebody whom Medhurst suspected; but\\r\\nafter a short investigation (conducted, I may say, with admirable\\r\\ncleverness), the spy always showed us the doubtful person was\\r\\nreally some innocent and well-known character, whose antecedents\\r\\nand surroundings he elucidated most wonderfully. He was a perfect\\r\\nmarvel, too, in his faculty of suspicion. He suspected everybody. If\\r\\nan old friend dropped in to talk business with Charles, we found out\\r\\nafterwards that Medhurst had lain concealed all the time behind the\\r\\ncurtain, and had taken short-hand notes of the whole conversation,\\r\\nas well as snap-shot photographs of the supposed sharper, by means\\r\\nof a kodak. If a fat old lady came to call upon Amelia, Medhurst\\r\\nwas sure to be lurking under the ottoman in the drawing-room, and\\r\\ncarefully observing, with all his eyes, whether or not she was\\r\\nreally Mme. Picardet, padded. When Lady Tresco brought her four\\r\\nplain daughters to an \"At Home\" one night, Medhurst, in evening\\r\\ndress, disguised as a waiter, followed them each round the room with\\r\\nobtrusive ices, to satisfy himself just how much of their complexion\\r\\nwas real, and how much was patent rouge and Bloom of Ninon. He\\r\\ndoubted whether Simpson, Sir Charles\\'s valet, was not Colonel Clay\\r\\nin plain clothes; and he had half an idea that C\\xc3\\xa9sarine herself was\\r\\nour saucy White Heather in an alternative avatar. We pointed out\\r\\nto him in vain that Simpson had often been present in the very\\r\\nsame room with David Granton, and that C\\xc3\\xa9sarine had dressed Mrs.\\r\\nBrabazon\\'s hair at Lucerne: this partially satisfied him, but only\\r\\npartially. He remarked that Simpson might double both parts with\\r\\nsomebody else unknown; and that as for C\\xc3\\xa9sarine, she might well\\r\\nhave a twin sister who took her place when she was Mme. Picardet.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, in spite of all his care--or because of all his care--Colonel\\r\\nClay stopped away for whole weeks together. An explanation occurred\\r\\nto us. Was it possible he knew we were guarded and watched? Was he\\r\\nafraid of measuring swords with this trained detective?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf so, how had he found it out? I had an inkling, myself--but, under\\r\\nall the circumstances, I did not mention it to Charles. It was clear\\r\\nthat C\\xc3\\xa9sarine intensely disliked this new addition to the Vandrift\\r\\nhousehold. She would not stop in the room where the detective was,\\r\\nor show him common politeness. She spoke of him always as \"that\\r\\nodious man, Medhurst.\" Could she have guessed, what none of the\\r\\nother servants knew, that the man was a spy in search of the\\r\\nColonel? I was inclined to believe it. And then it dawned upon me\\r\\nthat C\\xc3\\xa9sarine had known all about the diamonds and their story; that\\r\\nit was C\\xc3\\xa9sarine who took us to see Schloss Lebenstein; that it was\\r\\nC\\xc3\\xa9sarine who posted the letter to Lord Craig-Ellachie! If C\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\r\\nwas in league with Colonel Clay, as I was half inclined to surmise,\\r\\nwhat more natural than her obvious dislike to the detective who was\\r\\nthere to catch her principal? What more simple for her than to warn\\r\\nher fellow-conspirator of the danger that awaited him if he\\r\\napproached this man Medhurst?\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I was too much frightened by the episode of the cheque to\\r\\nsay anything of my nascent suspicions to Charles. I waited rather\\r\\nto see how events would shape themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while Medhurst\\'s vigilance grew positively annoying. More\\r\\nthan once he came to Charles with reports and shorthand notes\\r\\ndistinctly distasteful to my excellent brother-in-law. \"The fellow\\r\\nis getting to know too much about us,\" Charles said to me one day.\\r\\n\"Why, Sey, he spies out everything. Would you believe it, when I had\\r\\nthat confidential interview with Brookfield the other day, about the\\r\\nnew issue of Golcondas, the man was under the easy-chair, though I\\r\\nsearched the room beforehand to make sure he wasn\\'t there; and he\\r\\ncame to me afterwards with full notes of the conversation, to assure\\r\\nme he thought Brookfield--whom I\\'ve known for ten years--was too\\r\\ntall by half an inch to be one of Colonel Clay\\'s impersonations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, but, Sir Charles,\" Medhurst cried, emerging suddenly from the\\r\\nbookcase, \"you must never look upon _any one_ as above suspicion\\r\\nmerely because you\\'ve known him for ten years or thereabouts.\\r\\nColonel Clay may have approached you at various times under many\\r\\ndisguises. He may have built up this thing gradually. Besides, as to\\r\\nmy knowing too much, why, of course, a detective always learns many\\r\\nthings about his employer\\'s family which he is not supposed to know;\\r\\nbut professional honour and professional etiquette, as with doctors\\r\\nand lawyers, compel him to lock them up as absolute secrets in his\\r\\nown bosom. You need never be afraid I will divulge one jot of them.\\r\\nIf I did, my occupation would be gone, and my reputation shattered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles looked at him, appalled. \"Do you dare to say,\" he burst out,\\r\\n\"you\\'ve been listening to my talk with my brother-in-law and\\r\\nsecretary?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, of course,\" Medhurst answered. \"It\\'s my business to listen,\\r\\nand to suspect everybody. If you push me to say so, how do I know\\r\\nColonel Clay is not--Mr. Wentworth?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles withered him with a look. \"In future, Medhurst,\" he said,\\r\\n\"you must never conceal yourself in a room where I am without my\\r\\nleave and knowledge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMedhurst bowed politely. \"Oh, as you will, Sir Charles,\" he\\r\\nanswered; \"that\\'s _quite_ at your own wish. Though how can I act\\r\\nas an efficient detective, any way, if you insist upon tying my\\r\\nhands like that, beforehand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain I detected a faint American flavour.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that rebuff, however, Medhurst seemed put upon his mettle. He\\r\\nredoubled his vigilance in every direction. \"It\\'s not my fault,\" he\\r\\nsaid plaintively, one day, \"if my reputation\\'s so good that, while\\r\\nI\\'m near you, this rogue won\\'t approach you. If I can\\'t _catch_ him,\\r\\nat least I keep him away from coming near you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days later, however, he brought Charles some photographs.\\r\\nThese he produced with evident pride. The first he showed us was a\\r\\nvignette of a little parson. \"Who\\'s that, then?\" he inquired, much\\r\\npleased.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe gazed at it, open-eyed. One word rose to our lips simultaneously:\\r\\n\"Brabazon!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how\\'s this for high?\" he asked again, producing another--the\\r\\nphotograph of a gay young dog in a Tyrolese costume.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe murmured, \"Von Lebenstein!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_And_ this?\" he continued, showing us the portrait of a lady with a\\r\\nmost fetching squint.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe answered with one voice, \"Little Mrs. Granton!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMedhurst was naturally proud of this excellent exploit. He replaced\\r\\nthem in his pocket-book with an air of just triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How did you get them?\" Charles asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedhurst\\'s look was mysterious. \"Sir Charles,\" he answered, drawing\\r\\nhimself up, \"I must ask you to trust me awhile in this matter.\\r\\nRemember, there are people whom you decline to suspect. _I_ have\\r\\nlearned that it is always those very people who are most dangerous\\r\\nto capitalists. If I were to give you the names now, you would\\r\\nrefuse to believe me. Therefore, I hold them over discreetly for\\r\\nthe moment. One thing, however, I say. I _know_ to a certainty where\\r\\nColonel Clay is at this present speaking. But I will lay my plans\\r\\ndeep, and I hope before long to secure him. You shall be present\\r\\nwhen I do so; and I shall make him confess his personality openly.\\r\\nMore than that you cannot reasonably ask. I shall leave it to\\r\\n_you_, then, whether or not you wish to arrest him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was considerably puzzled, not to say piqued, by this curious\\r\\nreticence; he begged hard for names; but Medhurst was adamant. \"No,\\r\\nno,\" he replied; \"we detectives have our own just pride in our\\r\\nprofession. If I told you now, you would probably spoil all by some\\r\\npremature action. You are too open and impulsive! I will mention\\r\\nthis alone: Colonel Clay will be shortly in Paris, and before long\\r\\nwill begin from that city a fresh attempt at defrauding you, which\\r\\nhe is now hatching. Mark my words, and see whether or not I have\\r\\nbeen kept well informed of the fellow\\'s movements!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was perfectly correct. Two days later, as it turned out, Charles\\r\\nreceived a \"confidential\" letter from Paris, purporting to come\\r\\nfrom the head of a second-rate financial house with which he had\\r\\nhad dealings over the Craig-Ellachie Amalgamation--by this time,\\r\\nI ought to have said, an accomplished union. It was a letter of\\r\\nsmall importance in itself--a mere matter of detail; but it paved\\r\\nthe way, so Medhurst thought, to some later development of more\\r\\nserious character. Here once more the man\\'s singular foresight was\\r\\njustified. For, in another week, we received a second communication,\\r\\ncontaining other proposals of a delicate financial character, which\\r\\nwould have involved the transference of some two thousand pounds\\r\\nto the head of the Parisian firm at an address given. Both these\\r\\nletters Medhurst cleverly compared with those written to Charles\\r\\nbefore, in the names of Colonel Clay and of Graf von Lebenstein.\\r\\nAt first sight, it is true, the differences between the two seemed\\r\\nquite enormous: the Paris hand was broad and black, large and bold;\\r\\nwhile the earlier manuscript was small, neat, thin, and gentlemanly.\\r\\nStill, when Medhurst pointed out to us certain persistent twists in\\r\\nthe formation of his capitals, and certain curious peculiarities in\\r\\nthe relative length of his t\\'s, his l\\'s, his b\\'s, and his h\\'s, we\\r\\ncould see for ourselves he was right; both were the work of one hand,\\r\\nwriting in the one case with a sharp-pointed nib, very small, and in\\r\\nthe other with a quill, very large and freely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis discovery was _most_ important. We stood now within measurable\\r\\ndistance of catching Colonel Clay, and bringing forgery and fraud\\r\\nhome to him without hope of evasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make all sure, however, Medhurst communicated with the Paris\\r\\npolice, and showed us their answers. Meanwhile, Charles continued to\\r\\nwrite to the head of the firm, who had given a private address in\\r\\nthe Rue Jean Jacques, alleging, I must say, a most clever reason why\\r\\nthe negotiations at this stage should be confidentially conducted.\\r\\nBut one never expected from Colonel Clay anything less than\\r\\nconsummate cleverness. In the end, it was arranged that we three\\r\\nwere to go over to Paris together, that Medhurst was to undertake,\\r\\nunder the guise of being Sir Charles, to pay the two thousand pounds\\r\\nto the pretended financier, and that Charles and I, waiting with the\\r\\npolice outside the door, should, at a given signal, rush in with our\\r\\nforces and secure the criminal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went over accordingly, and spent the night at the Grand, as is\\r\\nCharles\\'s custom. The Bristol, which I prefer, he finds too quiet.\\r\\nEarly next morning we took a fiacre and drove to the Rue Jean\\r\\nJacques. Medhurst had arranged everything in advance with the Paris\\r\\npolice, three of whom, in plain clothes, were waiting at the foot\\r\\nof the staircase to assist us. Charles had further provided himself\\r\\nwith two thousand pounds, in notes of the Bank of France, in order\\r\\nthat the payment might be duly made, and no doubt arise as to the\\r\\ncrime having been perpetrated as well as meditated--in the former\\r\\ncase, the penalty would be fifteen years; in the latter, three only.\\r\\nHe was in very high spirits. The fact that we had tracked the rascal\\r\\nto earth at last, and were within an hour of apprehending him, was\\r\\nin itself enough to raise his courage greatly. We found, as we\\r\\nexpected, that the number given in the Rue Jean Jacques was that\\r\\nof an hotel, not a private residence. Medhurst went in first, and\\r\\ninquired of the landlord whether our man was at home, at the same\\r\\ntime informing him of the nature of our errand, and giving him to\\r\\nunderstand that if we effected the capture by his friendly aid, Sir\\r\\nCharles would see that the expenses incurred on the swindler\\'s bill\\r\\nwere met in full, as the price of his assistance. The landlord\\r\\nbowed; he expressed his deep regret, as M. le Colonel--so we\\r\\nheard him call him--was a most amiable person, much liked by the\\r\\nhousehold; but justice, of course, must have its way; and, with a\\r\\nregretful sigh, he undertook to assist us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe police remained below, but Charles and Medhurst were each\\r\\nprovided with a pair of handcuffs. Remembering the Polperro case,\\r\\nhowever, we determined to use them with the greatest caution. We\\r\\nwould only put them on in case of violent resistance. We crept up to\\r\\nthe door where the miscreant was housed. Charles handed the notes in\\r\\nan open envelope to Medhurst, who seized them hastily and held them\\r\\nin his hands in readiness for action. We had a sign concerted.\\r\\nWhenever he sneezed--which he could do in the most natural\\r\\nmanner--we were to open the door, rush in, and secure the criminal!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was gone for some minutes. Charles and I waited outside in\\r\\nbreathless expectation. Then Medhurst sneezed. We flung the door\\r\\nopen at once, and burst in upon the creature.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedhurst rose as we did so. He pointed with his finger. \"_This_ is\\r\\nColonel Clay!\" he said; \"keep him well in charge while I go down\\r\\nto the door for the police to arrest him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA gentlemanly man, about middle height, with a grizzled beard and a\\r\\nwell-assumed military aspect, rose at the same moment. The envelope\\r\\nin which Charles had placed the notes lay on the table before him.\\r\\nHe clutched it nervously. \"I am at a loss, gentlemen,\" he said, in\\r\\nan excited voice, \"to account for this interruption.\" He spoke with\\r\\na tremor, yet with all the politeness to which we were accustomed in\\r\\nthe little curate and the Honourable David.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No nonsense!\" Charles exclaimed, in his authoritative way. \"We know\\r\\nwho you are. We have found you out this time. You are Colonel Clay.\\r\\nIf you attempt to resist--take care--I will handcuff you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe military gentleman gave a start. \"Yes, I _am_ Colonel Clay,\" he\\r\\nanswered. \"On what charge do you arrest me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was bursting with wrath. The fellow\\'s coolness seemed never\\r\\nto desert him. \"You _are_ Colonel Clay!\" he muttered. \"You have the\\r\\nunspeakable effrontery to stand there and admit it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" the Colonel answered, growing hot in turn. \"I have done\\r\\nnothing to be ashamed of. What do you mean by this conduct? How dare\\r\\nyou talk of arresting me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles laid his hand on the man\\'s shoulder. \"Come, come, my\\r\\nfriend,\" he said. \"That sort of bluff won\\'t go down with us. You\\r\\nknow very well on what charge I arrest you; and here are the police\\r\\nto give effect to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe called out \"Entrez!\" The police entered the room. Charles\\r\\nexplained as well as he could in most doubtful Parisian what they\\r\\nwere next to do. The Colonel drew himself up in an indignant\\r\\nattitude. He turned and addressed them in excellent French.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am an officer in the service of her Britannic Majesty,\" he said.\\r\\n\"On what ground do you venture to interfere with me, messieurs?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief policeman explained. The Colonel turned to Charles.\\r\\n\"_Your_ name, sir?\" he inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know it very well,\" Charles answered. \"I am Sir Charles\\r\\nVandrift; and, in spite of your clever disguise, I can instantly\\r\\nrecognise you. I know your eyes and ears. I can see the same man\\r\\nwho cheated me at Nice, and who insulted me on the island.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_You_ Sir Charles Vandrift!\" the rogue cried. \"No, no, sir, you are\\r\\na madman!\" He looked round at the police. \"Take care what you do!\"\\r\\nhe cried. \"This is a raving maniac. I had business just now with Sir\\r\\nCharles Vandrift, who quitted the room as these gentlemen entered.\\r\\nThis person is mad, and you, monsieur, I doubt not,\" bowing to me,\\r\\n\"you are, of course, his keeper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not let him deceive you,\" I cried to the police, beginning to\\r\\nfear that with his usual incredible cleverness the fellow would\\r\\neven now manage to slip through our fingers. \"Arrest him, as you\\r\\nare told. _We_ will take the responsibility.\" Though I trembled when\\r\\nI thought of that cheque he held of mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief of our three policemen came forward and laid his hand on\\r\\nthe culprit\\'s shoulder. \"I advise you, M. le Colonel,\" he said, in\\r\\nan official voice, \"to come with us quietly for the present. Before\\r\\nthe juge d\\'instruction we can enter at length into all these\\r\\nquestions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colonel, very indignant still--and acting the part\\r\\nmarvellously--yielded and went along with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where\\'s Medhurst?\" Charles inquired, glancing round as we reached\\r\\nthe door. \"I wish he had stopped with us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are looking for monsieur your friend?\" the landlord inquired,\\r\\nwith a side bow to the Colonel. \"He has gone away in a fiacre. He\\r\\nasked me to give this note to you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe handed us a twisted note. Charles opened and read it. \"Invaluable\\r\\nman!\" he cried. \"Just hear what he says, Sey: \\'Having secured\\r\\nColonel Clay, I am off now again on the track of Mme. Picardet.\\r\\nShe was lodging in the same house. She has just driven away; I know\\r\\nto what place; and I am after her to arrest her. In blind haste,\\r\\nMEDHURST.\\' That\\'s smartness, IF you like. Though, poor little woman,\\r\\nI think he might have left her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Does a Mme. Picardet stop here?\" I inquired of the landlord,\\r\\nthinking it possible she might have assumed again the same old\\r\\nalias.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe nodded assent. \"Oui, oui, oui,\" he answered. \"She has just driven\\r\\noff, and monsieur your friend has gone posting after her.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Splendid man!\" Charles cried. \"Marvillier was quite right. He is\\r\\nthe prince of detectives!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hailed a couple of fiacres, and drove off, in two detachments,\\r\\nto the juge d\\'instruction. There Colonel Clay continued to brazen\\r\\nit out, and asserted that he was an officer in the Indian Army, home\\r\\non six months\\' leave, and spending some weeks in Paris. He even\\r\\ndeclared he was known at the Embassy, where he had a cousin an\\r\\nattach\\xc3\\xa9; and he asked that this gentleman should be sent for at once\\r\\nfrom our Ambassador\\'s to identify him. The juge d\\'instruction\\r\\ninsisted that this must be done; and Charles waited in very bad\\r\\nhumour for the foolish formality. It really seemed as if, after all,\\r\\nwhen we had actually caught and arrested our man, he was going by\\r\\nsome cunning device to escape us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a delay of more than an hour, during which Colonel Clay\\r\\nfretted and fumed quite as much as we did, the attach\\xc3\\xa9 arrived. To\\r\\nour horror and astonishment, he proceeded to salute the prisoner\\r\\nmost affectionately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Halloa, Algy!\" he cried, grasping his hand; \"what\\'s up? What do\\r\\nthese ruffians want with you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt began to dawn upon us, then, what Medhurst had meant by\\r\\n\"suspecting everybody\": the real Colonel Clay was no common\\r\\nadventurer, but a gentleman of birth and high connections!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colonel glared at us. \"This fellow declares he\\'s Sir Charles\\r\\nVandrift,\" he said sulkily. \"Though, in fact, there are two of them.\\r\\nAnd he accuses me of forgery, fraud, and theft, Bertie.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attach\\xc3\\xa9 stared hard at us. \"This _is_ Sir Charles Vandrift,\" he\\r\\nreplied, after a moment. \"I remember hearing him make a speech once\\r\\nat a City dinner. And what charge have you to prefer, Sir Charles,\\r\\nagainst my cousin?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Your cousin?\" Charles cried. \"This is Colonel Clay, the notorious\\r\\nsharper!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attach\\xc3\\xa9 smiled a gentlemanly and superior smile. \"This is\\r\\nColonel Clay,\" he answered, \"of the Bengal Staff Corps.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt began to strike us there was something wrong somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But he has cheated me, all the same,\" Charles said--\"at Nice two\\r\\nyears ago, and many times since; and this very day he has tricked me\\r\\nout of two thousand pounds in French bank-notes, which he has now\\r\\nabout him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colonel was speechless. But the attach\\xc3\\xa9 laughed. \"What he has\\r\\ndone to-day I don\\'t know,\" he said; \"but if it\\'s as apocryphal as\\r\\nwhat you say he did two years ago, you\\'ve a thundering bad case,\\r\\nsir; for he was then in India, and I was out there, visiting him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are the two thousand pounds?\" Charles cried. \"Why, you\\'ve got\\r\\nthem in your hand! You\\'re holding the envelope!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colonel produced it. \"This envelope,\" he said, \"was left with me\\r\\nby the man with short stiff hair, who came just before you, and who\\r\\nannounced himself as Sir Charles Vandrift. He said he was interested\\r\\nin tea in Assam, and wanted me to join the board of directors of\\r\\nsome bogus company. These are his papers, I believe,\" and he handed\\r\\nthem to his cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I\\'m glad the notes are safe, anyhow,\" Charles murmured, in a\\r\\ntone of relief, beginning to smell a rat. \"Will you kindly return\\r\\nthem to me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe attach\\xc3\\xa9 turned out the contents of the envelope. They proved to\\r\\nbe prospectuses of bubble companies of the moment, of no importance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Medhurst must have put them there,\" I cried, \"and decamped with the\\r\\ncash.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles gave a groan of horror. \"And Medhurst is Colonel Clay!\" he\\r\\nexclaimed, clapping his hand to his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" the Colonel interposed. \"I have but one\\r\\npersonality, and no aliases.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took quite half an hour to explain this imbroglio. But as soon as\\r\\nall was explained, in French and English, to the satisfaction of\\r\\nourselves and the juge d\\'instruction, the real Colonel shook hands\\r\\nwith us in a most forgiving way, and informed us that he had more\\r\\nthan once wondered, when he gave his name at shops in Paris, why\\r\\nit was often received with such grave suspicion. We instructed\\r\\nthe police that the true culprit was Medhurst, whom they had seen\\r\\nwith their own eyes, and whom we urged them to pursue with all\\r\\nexpedition. Meanwhile, Charles and I, accompanied by the Colonel\\r\\nand the attach\\xc3\\xa9--\"to see the fun out,\" as they said--called at the\\r\\nBank of France for the purpose of stopping the notes immediately. It\\r\\nwas too late, however. They had been presented at once, and cashed\\r\\nin gold, by a pleasant little lady in an American costume, who was\\r\\nafterwards identified by the hotel-keeper (from our description) as\\r\\nhis lodger, Mme. Picardet. It was clear she had taken rooms in the\\r\\nsame hotel, to be near the Indian Colonel; and it was _she_ who had\\r\\nreceived and sent the letters. As for our foe, he had vanished into\\r\\nspace, as always.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days later we received the usual insulting communication on a\\r\\nsheet of Charles\\'s own dainty note. Last time he wrote it was on\\r\\nCraig-Ellachie paper: this time, like the wanton lapwing, he had got\\r\\nhimself another crest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MOST PERSPICACIOUS OF MILLIONAIRES!--Said I not well, as\\r\\nMedhurst, that you must distrust everybody? And the one man\\r\\nyou never dreamt of distrusting was--Medhurst. Yet see how\\r\\ntruthful I was! I told you I knew where Colonel Clay was\\r\\nliving--and I _did_ know, exactly. I promised to take you to\\r\\nColonel Clay\\'s rooms, and to get him arrested for you--and\\r\\nI kept my promise. I even exceeded your expectations; for\\r\\nI gave you _two_ Colonel Clays instead of one--and you took\\r\\nthe wrong man--that is to say, the real one. This was a neat\\r\\nlittle trick; but it cost me some trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"First, I found out there _was_ a real Colonel Clay, in the\\r\\nIndian Army. I also found out he chanced to be coming home on\\r\\nleave this season. I might have made more out of him, no doubt;\\r\\nbut I disliked annoying him, and preferred to give myself the\\r\\nfun of this peculiar mystification. I therefore waited for him\\r\\nto reach Paris, where the police arrangements suited me better\\r\\nthan in London. While I was looking about, and delaying\\r\\noperations for his return, I happened to hear you wanted a\\r\\ndetective. So I offered myself as out of work to my old\\r\\nemployer, Marvillier, from whom I have had many good jobs in the\\r\\npast; and there you get, in short, the kernel of the Colonel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Naturally, after this, I can never go back as a detective\\r\\nto Marvillier\\'s. But, on the large scale on which I have\\r\\nlearned to work since I first had the pleasure of making\\r\\nyour delightful acquaintance, this matters little. To say\\r\\nthe truth, I begin to feel detective work a cut or two below\\r\\nme. I am now a gentleman of means and leisure. Besides, the\\r\\nextra knowledge of your movements which I have acquired in\\r\\nyour house has helped still further to give me various holds\\r\\nupon you. So the fluke will be true to his own pet lamb. To\\r\\nvary the metaphor, you are not fully shorn yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Remember me most kindly to your charming family, give\\r\\nWentworth my love, and tell Mlle. C\\xc3\\xa9sarine I owe her a grudge\\r\\nwhich I shall never forget. She clearly suspected me. You are\\r\\nmuch too rich, dear Charles; I relieve your plethora. I bleed\\r\\nyou financially. Therefore I consider myself--Your sincerest\\r\\nfriend,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"CLAY-BRABAZON-MEDHURST,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was threatened with apoplexy. This blow was severe.\\r\\n\"Whom can I trust,\" he asked, plaintively, \"when the detectives\\r\\nthemselves, whom I employ to guard me, turn out to be swindlers?\\r\\nDon\\'t you remember that line in the Latin grammar--something about,\\r\\n\\'Who shall watch the watchers?\\' I think it used to run, \\'Quis\\r\\ncustodes custodiet ipsos?\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I felt this episode had at least disproved my suspicions of\\r\\npoor C\\xc3\\xa9sarine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE SELDON GOLD-MINE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn our return to London, Charles and Marvillier had a difference\\r\\nof opinion on the subject of Medhurst.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles maintained that Marvillier ought to have known the man\\r\\nwith the cropped hair was Colonel Clay, and ought never to have\\r\\nrecommended him. Marvillier maintained that Charles had _seen_\\r\\nColonel Clay half-a-dozen times, at least, to his own never; and\\r\\nthat my respected brother-in-law had therefore nobody on earth\\r\\nbut himself to blame if the rogue imposed upon him. The head\\r\\ndetective had known Medhurst for ten years, he said, as a most\\r\\nrespectable man, and even a ratepayer; he had always found him the\\r\\ncleverest of spies, as well he might be, indeed, on the familiar\\r\\nset-a-thief-to-catch-a-thief principle. However, the upshot of\\r\\nit all was, as usual--nothing. Marvillier was sorry to lose the\\r\\nservices of so excellent a hand; but he had done the very best\\r\\nhe could for Sir Charles, he declared; and if Sir Charles was\\r\\nnot satisfied, why, he might catch his Colonel Clays for himself\\r\\nin future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I will, Sey,\" Charles remarked to me, as we walked back from\\r\\nthe office in the Strand by Piccadilly. \"I won\\'t trust any more to\\r\\nthese private detectives. It\\'s my belief they\\'re a pack of thieves\\r\\nthemselves, in league with the rascals they\\'re set to catch, and\\r\\nwith no more sense of honour than a Zulu diamond-hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Better try the police,\" I suggested, by way of being helpful.\\r\\nOne must assume an interest in one\\'s employer\\'s business.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Charles shook his head. \"No, no,\" he said; \"I\\'m sick of all\\r\\nthese fellows. I shall trust in future to my own sagacity. We\\r\\nlearn by experience, Sey--and I\\'ve learned a thing or two. One of\\r\\nthem is this: It\\'s not enough to suspect everybody; you must have\\r\\nno preconceptions. Divest yourself entirely of every fixed idea\\r\\nif you wish to cope with a rascal of this calibre. Don\\'t jump at\\r\\nconclusions. We should disbelieve everything, as well as distrust\\r\\neverybody. That\\'s the road to success; and I mean to pursue it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, by way of pursuing it, Charles retired to Seldon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The longer the man goes on, the worse he grows,\" he said to me\\r\\none morning. \"He\\'s just like a tiger that has tasted blood. Every\\r\\nsuccessful haul seems only to make him more eager for another.\\r\\nI fully expect now before long we shall see him down here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout three weeks later, sure enough, my respected connection\\r\\nreceived a communication from the abandoned swindler, with\\r\\nan Austrian stamp and a Vienna post-mark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MY DEAR VANDRIFT.--(After so long and so varied an acquaintance\\r\\nwe may surely drop the absurd formalities of \\'Sir Charles\\' and\\r\\n\\'Colonel.\\') I write to ask you a delicate question. Can you kindly\\r\\ntell me exactly how much I have received from your various generous\\r\\nacts during the last three years? I have mislaid my account-book,\\r\\nand as this is the season for making the income tax return, I am\\r\\nanxious, as an honest and conscientious citizen, to set down my\\r\\naverage profits out of you for the triennial period. For reasons\\r\\nwhich you will amply understand, I do not this time give my private\\r\\naddress, in Paris or elsewhere; but if you will kindly advertise\\r\\nthe total amount, above the signature \\'Peter Simple,\\' in the Agony\\r\\nColumn of the Times, you will confer a great favour upon the\\r\\nRevenue Commissioners, and also upon your constant friend and\\r\\ncompanion, CUTHBERT CLAY,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Practical Socialist.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mark my word, Sey,\" Charles said, laying the letter down, \"in a\\r\\nweek or less the man himself will follow. This is his cunning way\\r\\nof trying to make me think he\\'s well out of the country and far\\r\\naway from Seldon. That means he\\'s meditating another descent. But\\r\\nhe told us too much last time, when he was Medhurst the detective.\\r\\nHe gave us some hints about disguises and their unmasking that I\\r\\nshall not forget. This turn I shall be even with him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday of that week, in effect, we were walking along the road\\r\\nthat leads into the village, when we met a gentlemanly-looking man,\\r\\nin a rough and rather happy-go-lucky brown tweed suit, who had the\\r\\nair of a tourist. He was middle-aged, and of middle height; he wore\\r\\na small leather wallet suspended round his shoulder; and he was\\r\\npeering about at the rocks in a suspicious manner. Something in\\r\\nhis gait attracted our attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good-morning,\" he said, looking up as we passed; and Charles\\r\\nmuttered a somewhat surly inarticulate, \"Good-morning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went on without saying more. \"Well, _that\\'s_ not Colonel Clay,\\r\\nanyhow,\" I said, as we got out of earshot. \"For he accosted us\\r\\nfirst; and you may remember it\\'s one of the Colonel\\'s most marked\\r\\npeculiarities that, like the model child, he never speaks till he\\'s\\r\\nspoken to--never begins an acquaintance. He always waits till we\\r\\nmake the first advance; he doesn\\'t go out of his way to cheat us;\\r\\nhe loiters about till we ask him to do it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seymour,\" my brother-in-law responded, in a severe tone, \"there\\r\\nyou are, now, doing the very thing I warned you not to do! You\\'re\\r\\nsuccumbing to a preconception. Avoid fixed ideas. The probability\\r\\nis this man _is_ Colonel Clay. Strangers are generally scarce at\\r\\nSeldon. If he isn\\'t Colonel Clay, what\\'s he here for, I\\'d like\\r\\nto know? What money is there to be made here in any other way?\\r\\nI shall inquire about him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe dropped in at the Cromarty Arms, and asked good Mrs. M\\'Lachlan\\r\\nif she could tell us anything about the gentlemanly stranger. Mrs.\\r\\nM\\'Lachlan replied that he was from London, she believed, a pleasant\\r\\ngentleman enough; and he had his wife with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ha! Young? Pretty?\" Charles inquired, with a speaking glance at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Weel, Sir Charles, she\\'ll no be exactly what you\\'d be ca\\'ing a\\r\\nbonny lass,\" Mrs. M\\'Lachlan replied; \"but she\\'s a guid body for\\r\\na\\' that, an\\' a fine braw woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just what I should expect,\" Charles murmured, \"He varies the\\r\\nprogramme. The fellow has tried White Heather as the parson\\'s wife,\\r\\nand as Madame Picardet, and as squinting little Mrs. Granton, and\\r\\nas Medhurst\\'s accomplice; and now, he has almost exhausted the\\r\\npossibilities of a disguise for a really young and pretty woman;\\r\\nso he\\'s playing her off at last as the riper product--a handsome\\r\\nmatron. Clever, extremely clever; but--we begin to see through him.\"\\r\\nAnd he chuckled to himself quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, on the hillside, we came upon our stranger again,\\r\\noccupied as before in peering into the rocks, and sounding them\\r\\nwith a hammer. Charles nudged me and whispered, \"I have it this\\r\\ntime. He\\'s posing as a geologist.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI took a good look at the man. By now, of course, we had some\\r\\nexperience of Colonel Clay in his various disguises; and I could\\r\\nobserve that while the nose, the hair, and the beard were varied,\\r\\nthe eyes and the build remained the same as ever. He was a trifle\\r\\nstouter, of course, being got up as a man of between forty and\\r\\nfifty; and his forehead was lined in a way which a less consummate\\r\\nartist than Colonel Clay could easily have imitated. But I felt we\\r\\nhad at least some grounds for our identification; it would not do\\r\\nto dismiss the suggestion of Clayhood at once as a flight of fancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wife was sitting near, upon a bare boss of rock, reading a\\r\\nvolume of poems. Capital variant, that, a volume of poems! Exactly\\r\\nsuited the selected type of a cultivated family. White Heather and\\r\\nMrs. Granton never used to read poems. But that was characteristic\\r\\nof all Colonel Clay\\'s impersonations, and Mrs. Clay\\'s too--for I\\r\\nsuppose I must call her so. They were not mere outer disguises;\\r\\nthey were finished pieces of dramatic study. Those two people were\\r\\nan actor and actress, as well as a pair of rogues; and in both\\r\\ntheir r\\xc3\\xb4les they were simply inimitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a rule, Charles is by no means polite to casual trespassers on\\r\\nthe Seldon estate; they get short shrift and a summary ejection.\\r\\nBut on this occasion he had a reason for being courteous, and he\\r\\napproached the lady with a bow of recognition. \"Lovely day,\" he\\r\\nsaid, \"isn\\'t it? Such belts on the sea, and the heather smells\\r\\nsweet. You are stopping at the inn, I fancy?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" the lady answered, looking up at him with a charming smile.\\r\\n(\"I know that smile,\" Charles whispered to me. \"I have succumbed to\\r\\nit too often.\") \"We\\'re stopping at the inn, and my husband is doing\\r\\na little geology on the hill here. I hope Sir Charles Vandrift won\\'t\\r\\ncome and catch us. He\\'s so down upon trespassers. They tell us at\\r\\nthe inn he\\'s a regular Tartar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(\"Saucy minx as ever,\" Charles murmured to me. \"She said it on\\r\\npurpose.\") \"No, my dear madam,\" he continued, aloud; \"you have\\r\\nbeen quite misinformed. _I_ am Sir Charles Vandrift; and I am _not_\\r\\na Tartar. If your husband is a man of science I respect and admire\\r\\nhim. It is geology that has made me what I am to-day.\" And he drew\\r\\nhimself up proudly. \"We owe to it the present development of South\\r\\nAfrican mining.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady blushed as one seldom sees a mature woman blush--but\\r\\nexactly as I had seen Madame Picardet and White Heather. \"Oh, I\\'m\\r\\nso sorry,\" she said, in a confused way that recalled Mrs. Granton.\\r\\n\"Forgive my hasty speech. I--I didn\\'t know you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(\"She did,\" Charles whispered. \"But let that pass.\") \"Oh, don\\'t\\r\\nthink of it again; so many people disturb the birds, don\\'t you know,\\r\\nthat we\\'re obliged in self-defence to warn trespassers sometimes off\\r\\nour lovely mountains. But I do it with regret--with profound regret.\\r\\nI admire the--er--the beauties of Nature myself; and, therefore,\\r\\nI desire that all others should have the freest possible access\\r\\nto them--possible, that is to say, consistently with the superior\\r\\nclaims of Property.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see,\" the lady replied, looking up at him quaintly. \"I admire\\r\\nyour wish, though not your reservation. I\\'ve just been reading\\r\\nthose sweet lines of Wordsworth\\'s--\\r\\n\\r\\n  And O, ye fountains, meadows, hills, and groves,\\r\\n  Forebode not any severing of our loves.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose you know them?\" And she beamed on him pleasantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Know them?\" Charles answered. \"Know them! Oh, of course, I know\\r\\nthem. They\\'re old favourites of mine--in fact, I adore Wordsworth.\"\\r\\n(I doubt whether Charles has ever in his life read a line of poetry,\\r\\nexcept Doss Chiderdoss in the Sporting Times.) He took the book\\r\\nand glanced at them. \"Ah, charming, charming!\" he said, in his most\\r\\necstatic tone. But his eyes were on the lady, and not on the poet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw in a moment how things stood. No matter under what disguise\\r\\nthat woman appeared to him, and whether he recognised her or not,\\r\\nCharles couldn\\'t help falling a victim to Madame Picardet\\'s\\r\\nattractions. Here he actually suspected her; yet, like a moth\\r\\nround a candle, he was trying his hardest to get his wings singed!\\r\\nI almost despised him with his gigantic intellect! The greatest\\r\\nmen are the greatest fools, I verily believe, when there\\'s a woman\\r\\nin question.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe husband strolled up by this time, and entered into conversation\\r\\nwith us. According to his own account, his name was Forbes-Gaskell,\\r\\nand he was a Professor of Geology in one of those new-fangled\\r\\nnorthern colleges. He had come to Seldon rock-spying, he said, and\\r\\nfound much to interest him. He was fond of fossils, but his special\\r\\nhobby was rocks and minerals. He knew a vast deal about cairngorms\\r\\nand agates and such-like pretty things, and showed Charles quartz\\r\\nand felspar and red cornelian, and I don\\'t know what else, in the\\r\\ncrags on the hillside. Charles pretended to listen to him with the\\r\\ndeepest interest and even respect, never for a moment letting him\\r\\nguess he knew for what purpose this show of knowledge had been\\r\\nrecently acquired. If we were ever to catch the man, we must not\\r\\nallow him to see we suspected him. So Charles played a dark game.\\r\\nHe swallowed the geologist whole without question.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of that morning we spent with them on the hillside. Charles\\r\\ntook them everywhere and showed them everything. He pretended to be\\r\\npolite to the scientific man, and he was really polite, most polite,\\r\\nto the poetical lady. Before lunch time we had become quite friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Clays were always easy people to get on with; and, bar their\\r\\nroguery, we could not deny they were delightful companions. Charles\\r\\nasked them in to lunch. They accepted willingly. He introduced them\\r\\nto Amelia with sundry raisings of his eyebrows and contortions\\r\\nof his mouth. \"Professor and Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell,\" he said,\\r\\nhalf-dislocating his jaw with his violent efforts. \"They\\'re stopping\\r\\nat the inn, dear. I\\'ve been showing them over the place, and they\\'re\\r\\ngood enough to say they\\'ll drop in and take a share in our cold\\r\\nroast mutton;\" which was a frequent form of Charles\\'s pleasantry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmelia sent them upstairs to wash their hands--which, in the\\r\\nProfessor\\'s case, was certainly desirable, for his fingers were\\r\\ngrimed with earth and dust from the rocks he had been investigating.\\r\\nAs soon as we were left alone Charles drew me into the library.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seymour,\" he said, \"more than ever there is a need for us strictly\\r\\nto avoid preconceptions. We must not make up our minds that this man\\r\\nis Colonel Clay--nor, again, that he isn\\'t. We must remember that we\\r\\nhave been mistaken in _both_ ways in the past, and must avoid our\\r\\nold errors. I shall hold myself in readiness for either event--and\\r\\na policeman in readiness to arrest them, if necessary!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A capital plan,\" I murmured. \"Still, if I may venture a suggestion,\\r\\nin what way are these two people endeavouring to entrap us? They\\r\\nhave no scheme on hand--no schloss, no amalgamation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seymour,\" my brother-in-law answered in his board-room style, \"you\\r\\nare a great deal too previous, as Medhurst used to say--I mean,\\r\\nColonel Clay in his character as Medhurst. In the first place, these\\r\\nare early days; our friends have not yet developed their intentions.\\r\\nWe may find before long they have a property to sell, or a company\\r\\nto promote, or a concession to exploit in South Africa or elsewhere.\\r\\nThen again, in the second place, we don\\'t always spot the exact\\r\\nnature of their plan until it has burst in our hands, so to speak,\\r\\nand revealed its true character. What could have seemed more\\r\\ntransparent than Medhurst, the detective, till he ran away with our\\r\\nnotes in the very moment of triumph? What more innocent than White\\r\\nHeather and the little curate, till they landed us with a couple\\r\\nof Amelia\\'s own gems as a splendid bargain? I will not take it for\\r\\ngranted _any_ man is not Colonel Clay, merely because I don\\'t happen\\r\\nto spot the particular scheme he is trying to work against me. The\\r\\nrogue has so many schemes, and some of them so well concealed, that\\r\\nup to the moment of the actual explosion you fail to detect the\\r\\npresence of moral dynamite. Therefore, I shall proceed as if there\\r\\nwere dynamite everywhere. But in the third place--and this is _very_\\r\\nimportant--you mark my words, I believe I detect already the lines\\r\\nhe will work upon. He\\'s a geologist, he says, with a taste for\\r\\nminerals. Very good. You see if he doesn\\'t try to persuade me before\\r\\nlong he has found a coal mine, whose locality he will disclose for\\r\\na trifling consideration; or else he will salt the Long Mountain\\r\\nwith emeralds, and claim a big share for helping to discover them;\\r\\nor else he will try something in the mineralogical line to _do_ me\\r\\nsomehow. I see it in the very transparency of the fellow\\'s face;\\r\\nand I\\'m determined this time neither to pay him one farthing on\\r\\nany pretext, nor to let him escape me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went in to lunch. The Professor and Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell, all\\r\\nsmiles, accompanied us. I don\\'t know whether it was Charles\\'s\\r\\nwarning to take nothing for granted that made me do so--but I kept\\r\\na close eye upon the suspected man all the time we were at table.\\r\\nIt struck me there was something very odd about his hair. It\\r\\ndidn\\'t seem quite the same colour all over. The locks that hung\\r\\ndown behind, over the collar of his coat, were a trifle lighter and\\r\\na trifle grayer than the black mass that covered the greater part\\r\\nof his head. I examined it carefully. The more I did so, the more\\r\\nthe conviction grew upon me: he was wearing a wig. There was no\\r\\ndenying it!\\r\\n\\r\\nA trifle less artistic, perhaps, than most of Colonel Clay\\'s\\r\\nget-ups; but then, I reflected (on Charles\\'s principle of taking\\r\\nnothing for granted), we had never before suspected Colonel Clay\\r\\nhimself, except in the one case of the Honourable David, whose red\\r\\nhair and whiskers even Madame Picardet had admitted to be absurdly\\r\\nfalse by her action of pointing at them and tittering irrepressibly.\\r\\nIt was possible that in every case, if we had scrutinised our man\\r\\nclosely, we should have found that the disguise betrayed itself\\r\\nat once (as Medhurst had suggested) to an acute observer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detective, in fact, had told us too much. I remembered what he\\r\\nsaid to us about knocking off David Granton\\'s red wig the moment\\r\\nwe doubted him; and I positively tried to help myself awkwardly\\r\\nto potato-chips, when the footman offered them, so as to hit the\\r\\nsupposed wig with an apparently careless brush of my elbow. But\\r\\nit was of no avail. The fellow seemed to anticipate or suspect my\\r\\nintention, and dodged aside carefully, like one well accustomed\\r\\nto saving his disguise from all chance of such real or seeming\\r\\naccidents.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was so full of my discovery that immediately after lunch I induced\\r\\nIsabel to take our new friends round the home garden and show them\\r\\nCharles\\'s famous prize dahlias, while I proceeded myself to narrate\\r\\nto Charles and Amelia my observations and my frustrated experiment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It _is_ a wig,\" Amelia assented. \"_I_ spotted it at once. A very\\r\\ngood wig, too, and most artistically planted. Men don\\'t notice these\\r\\nthings, though women do. It is creditable to you, Seymour, to have\\r\\nsucceeded in detecting it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was less complimentary. \"You fool,\" he answered, with that\\r\\nunpleasant frankness which is much too common with him. \"Supposing\\r\\nit _is_, why on earth should you try to knock it off and disclose\\r\\nhim? What good would it have done? If it _is_ a wig, and we spot it,\\r\\nthat\\'s all that we need. We are put on our guard; we know with whom\\r\\nwe have now to deal. But you can\\'t take a man up on a charge of\\r\\nwig-wearing. The law doesn\\'t interfere with it. Most respectable men\\r\\nmay sometimes wear wigs. Why, I knew a promoter who did, and also\\r\\nthe director of fourteen companies! What we have to do next is, wait\\r\\ntill he tries to cheat us, and then--pounce down upon him. Sooner\\r\\nor later, you may be sure, his plans will reveal themselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we concocted an excellent scheme to keep them under constant\\r\\nobservation, lest they should slip away again, as they did from the\\r\\nisland. First of all, Amelia was to ask them to come and stop at the\\r\\ncastle, on the ground that the rooms at the inn were uncomfortably\\r\\nsmall. We felt sure, however, that, as on a previous occasion,\\r\\nthey would refuse the invitation, in order to be able to slink\\r\\noff unperceived, in case they should find themselves apparently\\r\\nsuspected. Should they decline, it was arranged that C\\xc3\\xa9sarine should\\r\\ntake a room at the Cromarty Arms as long as they stopped there, and\\r\\nreport upon their movements; while, during the day, we would have\\r\\nthe house watched by the head gillie\\'s son, a most intelligent\\r\\nyoung man, who could be trusted, with true Scotch canniness, to\\r\\nsay nothing to anybody.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo our immense surprise, Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell accepted the invitation\\r\\nwith the utmost alacrity. She was profuse in her thanks, indeed; for\\r\\nshe told us the Arms was an ill-kept house, and the cookery by no\\r\\nmeans agreed with her husband\\'s liver. It was sweet of us to invite\\r\\nthem; such kindness to perfect strangers was quite unexpected. She\\r\\nshould always say that nowhere on earth had she met with so cordial\\r\\nor friendly a reception as at Seldon Castle. But--she accepted,\\r\\nunreservedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It _can\\'t_ be Colonel Clay,\" I remarked to Charles. \"He would never\\r\\nhave come here. Even as David Granton, with far more reason for\\r\\ncoming, he wouldn\\'t put himself in our power: he preferred the\\r\\nsecurity and freedom of the Cromarty Arms.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sey,\" my brother-in-law said sententiously, \"you\\'re incorrigible.\\r\\nYou _will_ persist in being the slave of prepossessions. He may\\r\\nhave some good reason of his own for accepting. Wait till he shows\\r\\nhis hand--and then, we shall understand everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo for the next three weeks the Forbes-Gaskells formed part of the\\r\\nhouse-party at Seldon. I must say, Charles paid them most assiduous\\r\\nattention. He positively neglected his other guests in order to keep\\r\\nclose to the two new-comers. Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell noticed the fact,\\r\\nand commented on it. \"You are really too good to us, Sir Charles,\"\\r\\nshe said. \"I\\'m afraid you allow us quite to monopolise you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Charles, gallant as ever, replied with a smile, \"We have\\r\\nyou with us for so short a time, you know!\" Which made Mrs.\\r\\nForbes-Gaskell blush again that delicious blush of hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all this time the Professor went on calmly and persistently\\r\\nmineralogising. \"Wonderful character!\" Charles said to me. \"He works\\r\\nout his parts so well! Could anything exceed the picture he gives\\r\\none of scientific ardour?\" And, indeed, he was at it, morning, noon,\\r\\nand night. \"Sooner or later,\" Charles observed, \"something practical\\r\\nmust come of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTwice, meanwhile, little episodes occurred which are well worth\\r\\nnotice. One day I was out with the Professor on the Long Mountain,\\r\\nwatching him hammer at the rocks, and a little bored by his\\r\\nperformance, when, to pass the time, I asked him what a particular\\r\\nsmall water-worn stone was. He looked at it and smiled. \"If there\\r\\nwere a little more mica in it,\" he said, \"it would be the\\r\\ncharacteristic gneiss of ice-borne boulders, hereabouts. But\\r\\nthere isn\\'t _quite_ enough.\" And he gazed at it curiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Indeed,\" I answered, \"it doesn\\'t come up to sample, doesn\\'t it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave me a meaning look. \"Ten per cent,\" he murmured in a slow,\\r\\nstrange voice; \"ten per cent is more usual.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI trembled violently. Was he bent, then, upon ruining me? \"If you\\r\\nbetray me--\" I cried, and broke off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said. He was all pure innocence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI reflected on what Charles had said about taking nothing for\\r\\ngranted, and held my tongue prudently.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other incident was this. Charles picked a sprig of white heather\\r\\non the hill one afternoon, after a picnic lunch, I regret to say,\\r\\nwhen he had taken perhaps a glass more champagne than was strictly\\r\\ngood for him. He was not exactly the worse for it, but he was\\r\\nexcited, good-humoured, reckless, and lively. He brought the sprig\\r\\nto Mrs. Forbes-Gaskell, and handed it to her, ogling a little.\\r\\n\"Sweets to the sweet,\" he murmured, and looked at her meaningly.\\r\\n\"White heather to White Heather.\" Then he saw what he had done,\\r\\nand checked himself instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Forbes-Gaskell coloured up in the usual manner. \"I--I don\\'t\\r\\nquite understand,\" she faltered.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles scrambled out of it somehow. \"White heather for luck,\" he\\r\\nsaid, \"and--the man who is privileged to give a piece of it to you\\r\\nis surely lucky.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShe smiled, none too well pleased. I somehow felt she suspected us\\r\\nof suspecting her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, as it turned out, nothing came, after all, of the untoward\\r\\nincident.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day Charles burst upon me, triumphant. \"Well, he has shown\\r\\nhis hand!\" he cried. \"I knew he would. He has come to me to-day\\r\\nwith--what do you think?--a fragment of gold, in quartz, from the\\r\\nLong Mountain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No!\" I exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" Charles answered. \"He says there\\'s a vein there with distinct\\r\\nspecks of gold in it, which might be worth mining. When a man begins\\r\\n_that_ way you know what he\\'s driving at! And what\\'s more, he\\'s got\\r\\nup the subject beforehand; for he began saying to me there had long\\r\\nbeen gold in Sutherlandshire--why not therefore in Ross-shire?\\r\\nAnd then he went at full into the comparative geology of the two\\r\\nregions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is serious,\" I said. \"What will you do?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wait and watch,\" Charles answered; \"and the moment he develops a\\r\\nproposal for shares in the syndicate to work the mine, or a sum of\\r\\nmoney down as the price of his discovery--get in the police, and\\r\\narrest him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next few days the Professor was more active and ardent than\\r\\never. He went peering about the rocks on every side with his hammer.\\r\\nHe kept on bringing in little pieces of stone, with gold specks\\r\\nstuck in them, and talking learnedly of the \"probable cost of\\r\\ncrushing and milling.\" Charles had heard all that before; in\\r\\npoint of fact, he had assisted at the drafting of some dozens of\\r\\nprospectuses. So he took no notice, and waited for the man with the\\r\\nwig to develop his proposals. He knew they would come soon; and he\\r\\nwatched and waited. But, of course, to draw him on he pretended to\\r\\nbe interested.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we were all in this attitude of mind, attending on Providence\\r\\nand Colonel Clay, we happened to walk down by the shore one day, in\\r\\nthe opposite direction from the Seamew\\'s island. Suddenly we came\\r\\nupon the Professor linked arm-in-arm with--Sir Adolphus Cordery!\\r\\nThey were wrapped in deep talk, and appeared to be most amicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, naturally, relations had been a trifle strained between Sir\\r\\nAdolphus and the house of Vandrift since the incident of the Slump;\\r\\nbut under the present circumstances, and with such a matter at stake\\r\\nas the capture of Colonel Clay, it was necessary to overlook all\\r\\nsuch minor differences. So Charles managed to disengage the\\r\\nProfessor from his friend, sent Amelia on with Forbes-Gaskell\\r\\ntowards the castle, and stopped behind, himself, with Sir Adolphus\\r\\nand me, to clear up the question.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know this man, Cordery?\" he asked, with some little\\r\\nsuspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Know him? Why, of course I do,\" Sir Adolphus answered. \"He\\'s\\r\\nMarmaduke Forbes-Gaskell, of the Yorkshire College, a very\\r\\ndistinguished man of science. First-rate mineralogist--perhaps\\r\\nthe best (_but_ one) in England.\" Modesty forbade him to name the\\r\\nexception.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But are you sure it\\'s he?\" Charles inquired, with growing\\r\\ndoubt. \"Have you known him before? This isn\\'t a second case of\\r\\nSchleiermachering me, is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sure it\\'s he?\" Sir Adolphus echoed. \"Am I sure of myself? Why, I\\'ve\\r\\nknown Marmy Gaskell ever since we were at Trinity together. Knew him\\r\\nbefore he married Miss Forbes of Glenluce, my wife\\'s second cousin,\\r\\nand hyphened his name with hers, to keep the property in the family.\\r\\nKnow them both most intimately. Came down here to the inn because I\\r\\nheard that Marmy was on the prowl among these hills, and I thought he\\r\\nhad probably something good to prowl after--in the way of fossils.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the man wears a wig!\" Charles expostulated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" Cordery answered. \"He\\'s as bald as a bat--in front at\\r\\nleast--and he wears a wig to cover his baldness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s disgraceful,\" Charles exclaimed; \"disgraceful--taking us in\\r\\nlike that.\" And he grew red as a turkey-cock.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Adolphus has no delicacy. He burst out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I see,\" he cried out, simply bursting with amusement. \"You\\r\\nthought Forbes-Gaskell was Colonel Clay in disguise! Oh, my stars,\\r\\nwhat a lovely one!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_You_, at least, have no right to laugh,\" Charles responded, drawing\\r\\nhimself up and growing still redder. \"You led me once into a\\r\\nsimilar scrape, and then backed out of it in a way unbecoming a\\r\\ngentleman. Besides,\" he went on, getting angrier at each word,\\r\\n\"this fellow, whoever he is, has been trying to cheat me on his\\r\\nown account. Colonel Clay or no Colonel Clay, he\\'s been salting my\\r\\nrocks with gold-bearing quartz, and trying to lead me on into an\\r\\nabsurd speculation!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSir Adolphus exploded. \"Oh, this is too good,\" he cried. \"I must\\r\\ngo and tell Marmy!\" And he rushed off to where Forbes-Gaskell was\\r\\nseated on a corner of rock with Amelia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Charles and myself, we returned to the house. Half an hour\\r\\nlater Forbes-Gaskell came back, too, in a towering temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is the meaning of this, sir?\" he shouted out, as soon as\\r\\nhe caught sight of Charles. \"I\\'m told you\\'ve invited my wife\\r\\nand myself here to your house in order to spy upon us, under the\\r\\nimpression that I was Clay, the notorious swindler!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought you were,\" Charles answered, equally angry. \"Perhaps you\\r\\nmay be still! Anyhow, you\\'re a rogue, and you tried to bamboozle\\r\\nme!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nForbes-Gaskell, white with rage, turned to his trembling wife.\\r\\n\"Gertrude,\" he said, \"pack up your box and come away from these\\r\\npeople instantly. Their pretended hospitality has been a studied\\r\\ninsult. They\\'ve put you and me in a most ridiculous position. We\\r\\nwere told before we came here--and no doubt with truth--that Sir\\r\\nCharles Vandrift was the most close-fisted and tyrannical old\\r\\ncurmudgeon in Scotland. We\\'ve been writing to all our friends to\\r\\nsay ecstatically that he was, on the contrary, a most hospitable,\\r\\ngenerous, and large-hearted gentleman. And now we find out he\\'s a\\r\\ndisgusting cad, who asks strangers to his house from the meanest\\r\\nmotives, and then insults his guests with gratuitous vituperation.\\r\\nIt is well such people should hear the plain truth now and again in\\r\\ntheir lives; and it therefore gives me the greatest pleasure to tell\\r\\nSir Charles Vandrift that he\\'s a vulgar bounder of the first water.\\r\\nGo and pack your box, Gertrude! I\\'ll run down to the Cromarty Arms,\\r\\nand order a cab to carry us away at once from this inhospitable\\r\\nsham castle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You wear a wig, sir; you wear a wig,\" Charles exclaimed,\\r\\nhalf-choking with passion. For, indeed, as Forbes-Gaskell spoke,\\r\\nand tossed his head angrily, the nature of his hair-covering grew\\r\\npainfully apparent. It was quite one-sided.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do, sir, that I may be able to shake it in the face of a cad!\"\\r\\nthe Professor responded, tearing it off to readjust it; and, suiting\\r\\nthe action to the word, he brandished it thrice in Charles\\'s eyes;\\r\\nafter which he darted from the room, speechless with indignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as they were gone, and Charles had recovered breath\\r\\nsufficiently to listen to rational conversation, I ventured to\\r\\nobserve, \"This comes of being too sure! We made one mistake. We\\r\\ntook it for granted that because a man wears a wig, he _must_ be\\r\\nan impostor--which does not necessarily follow. We forgot that not\\r\\nColonel Clays alone have false coverings to their heads, and that\\r\\nwigs may sometimes be worn from motives of pure personal vanity.\\r\\nIn fact, we were again the slaves of preconceptions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at him pointedly. Charles rose before he replied. \"Seymour\\r\\nWentworth,\" he said at last, gazing down upon me with lofty scorn,\\r\\n\"your moralising is ill-timed. It appears to me you entirely\\r\\nmisunderstand the position and duties of a private secretary!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oddest part of it all, however, was this--that Charles, being\\r\\nconvinced Forbes-Gaskell, though he wasn\\'t Colonel Clay, had been\\r\\nfraudulently salting the rocks with gold, with intent to deceive,\\r\\ntook no further notice of the alleged discoveries. The consequence\\r\\nwas that Forbes-Gaskell and Sir Adolphus went elsewhere with the\\r\\nsecret; and it was not till after Charles had sold the Seldon\\r\\nCastle estate (which he did shortly afterward, the place having\\r\\nsomehow grown strangely distasteful to him) that the present\\r\\n\"Seldon Eldorados, Limited,\" were put upon the market by Lord\\r\\nCraig-Ellachie, who purchased the place from him. Forbes-Gaskell,\\r\\nas it happened, had reported to Craig-Ellachie that he had found\\r\\na lode of high-grade ore on an estate unnamed, which he would\\r\\nparticularise on promise of certain contingent claims to founder\\'s\\r\\nshares; and the old lord jumped at it. Charles sold at grouse-moor\\r\\nprices; and the consequence is that the capital of the Eldorados\\r\\nis yielding at present very fair returns, even after allowing for\\r\\nexpenses of promotion--while Charles has been done out of a good\\r\\nthing in gold-mines!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, remembering \"the position and duties of a private secretary,\"\\r\\nI refrained from pointing out to him at the time that this loss was\\r\\ndue to a fixed idea--though as a matter of fact it depended upon\\r\\nCharles\\'s strange preconception that the man with the wig, whoever\\r\\nhe might be, was trying to diddle him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE JAPANNED DISPATCH-BOX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sey,\" my brother-in-law said next spring, \"I\\'m sick and tired\\r\\nof London! Let\\'s shoulder our wallets at once, and I will to\\r\\nsome distant land, where no man doth me know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mars or Mercury?\" I inquired; \"for, in our own particular planet,\\r\\nI\\'m afraid you\\'ll find it just a trifle difficult for Sir Charles\\r\\nVandrift to hide his light under a bushel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I\\'ll manage it,\" Charles answered. \"What\\'s the good of being\\r\\na millionaire, I should like to know, if you\\'re always obliged to\\r\\n\\'behave as sich\\'? I shall travel incog. I\\'m dog-tired of being\\r\\ndogged by these endless impostors.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, indeed, we had passed through a most painful winter. Colonel\\r\\nClay had stopped away for some months, it is true, and for my own\\r\\npart, I will confess, since it wasn\\'t _my_ place to pay the piper, I\\r\\nrather missed the wonted excitement than otherwise. But Charles had\\r\\ngrown horribly and morbidly suspicious. He carried out his principle\\r\\nof \"distrusting everybody and disbelieving everything,\" till life\\r\\nwas a burden to him. He spotted impossible Colonel Clays under a\\r\\nthousand disguises; he was quite convinced he had frightened his\\r\\nenemy away at least a dozen times over, beneath the varying garb\\r\\nof a fat club waiter, a tall policeman, a washerwoman\\'s boy, a\\r\\nsolicitor\\'s clerk, the Bank of England beadle, and the collector\\r\\nof water-rates. He saw him as constantly, and in as changeful forms,\\r\\nas medi\\xc3\\xa6val saints used to see the devil. Amelia and I really\\r\\nbegan to fear for the stability of that splendid intellect; we\\r\\nforesaw that unless the Colonel Clay nuisance could be abated\\r\\nsomehow, Charles might sink by degrees to the mental level of a\\r\\ncommon or ordinary Stock-Exchange plunger.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when my brother-in-law announced his intention of going away\\r\\nincog. to parts unknown, on the succeeding Saturday, Amelia and\\r\\nI felt a flush of relief from long-continued tension. Especially\\r\\nAmelia--who was _not_ going with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For rest and quiet,\" he said to us at breakfast, laying down the\\r\\nMorning Post, \"give _me_ the deck of an Atlantic liner! No letters;\\r\\nno telegrams. No stocks; no shares. No Times; no Saturday. I\\'m sick\\r\\nof these papers!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The World is too much with us,\" I assented cheerfully. I regret\\r\\nto say, nobody appreciated the point of my quotation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles took infinite pains, I must admit, to ensure perfect\\r\\nsecrecy. He made me write and secure the best state-rooms--main\\r\\ndeck, amidships--under my own name, without mentioning his, in\\r\\nthe Etruria, for New York, on her very next voyage. He spoke of\\r\\nhis destination to nobody but Amelia; and Amelia warned C\\xc3\\xa9sarine,\\r\\nunder pains and penalties, on no account to betray it to the other\\r\\nservants. Further to secure his incog., Charles assumed the style\\r\\nand title of Mr. Peter Porter, and booked as such in the Etruria\\r\\nat Liverpool.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day before starting, however, he went down with me to the City\\r\\nfor an interview with his brokers in Adam\\'s Court, Old Broad Street.\\r\\nFinglemore, the senior partner, hastened, of course, to receive us.\\r\\nAs we entered his private room a good-looking young man rose and\\r\\nlounged out. \"Halloa, Finglemore,\" Charles said, \"that\\'s that scamp\\r\\nof a brother of yours! I thought you had shipped him off years and\\r\\nyears ago to China?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So I did, Sir Charles,\" Finglemore answered, rubbing his hands\\r\\nsomewhat nervously. \"But he never went there. Being an idle young\\r\\ndog, with a taste for amusement, he got for the time no further\\r\\nthan Paris. Since then, he\\'s hung about a bit, here, there, and\\r\\neverywhere, and done no particular good for himself or his family.\\r\\nBut about three or four years ago he somehow \\'struck ile\\': he went\\r\\nto South Africa, poaching on your preserves; and now he\\'s back\\r\\nagain--rich, married, and respectable. His wife, a nice little\\r\\nwoman, has reformed him. Well, what can I do for you this morning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles has large interests in America, in Santa F\\xc3\\xa9 and Topekas, and\\r\\nother big concerns; and he insisted on taking out several documents\\r\\nand vouchers connected in various ways with his widespread ventures\\r\\nthere. He meant to go, he said, for complete rest and change, on a\\r\\ngeneral tour of private inquiry--New York, Chicago, Colorado, the\\r\\nmining districts. It was a millionaire\\'s holiday. So he took all\\r\\nthese valuables in a black japanned dispatch-box, which he guarded\\r\\nlike a child with absurd precautions. He never allowed that box out\\r\\nof his sight one moment; and he gave me no peace as to its safety\\r\\nand integrity. It was a perfect fetish. \"We must be cautious,\" he\\r\\nsaid, \"Sey, cautious! Especially in travelling. Recollect how that\\r\\nlittle curate spirited the diamonds out of Amelia\\'s jewel-case! I\\r\\nshall not let this box out of my sight. I shall stick to it myself,\\r\\nif we go to the bottom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did _not_ go to the bottom. It is the proud boast of the Cunard\\r\\nCompany that it has \"never lost a passenger\\'s life\"; and the captain\\r\\nwould not consent to send the Etruria to Davy Jones\\'s locker, merely\\r\\nin order to give Charles a chance of sticking to his dispatch-box\\r\\nunder trying circumstances. On the contrary, we had a delightful\\r\\nand uneventful passage; and we found our fellow-passengers most\\r\\nagreeable people. Charles, as Mr. Peter Porter, being freed for\\r\\nthe moment from his terror of Colonel Clay, would have felt really\\r\\nhappy, I believe--had it not been for the dispatch-box. He made\\r\\nfriends from the first hour (quite after the fearless old fashion\\r\\nof the days before Colonel Clay had begun to embitter life for him)\\r\\nwith a nice American doctor and his charming wife, on their way back\\r\\nto Kentucky. Dr. Elihu Quackenboss--that was his characteristically\\r\\nAmerican name--had been studying medicine for a year in Vienna, and\\r\\nwas now returning to his native State with a brain close crammed\\r\\nwith all the latest bacteriological and antiseptic discoveries. His\\r\\nwife, a pretty and piquant little American, with a tip-tilted nose\\r\\nand the quaint sharpness of her countrywomen, amused Charles not a\\r\\nlittle. The funny way in which she would make room for him by her\\r\\nside on the bench on deck, and say, with a sweet smile, \"You sit\\r\\nright here, Mr. Porter; the sun\\'s just elegant,\" delighted and\\r\\nflattered him. He was proud to find out that female attention was\\r\\nnot always due to his wealth and title; and that plain Mr. Porter\\r\\ncould command on his merits the same amount of blandishments as Sir\\r\\nCharles Vandrift, the famous millionaire, on his South African\\r\\ncelebrity.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the whole of that voyage, it was Mrs. Quackenboss here, and\\r\\nMrs. Quackenboss there, and Mrs. Quackenboss the other place, till,\\r\\nfor Amelia\\'s sake, I was glad she was not on board to witness it.\\r\\nLong before we sighted Sandy Hook, I will admit, I was fairly sick\\r\\nof Charles\\'s two-stringed harp--Mrs. Quackenboss and the\\r\\ndispatch-box.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Quackenboss, it turned out, was an amateur artist, and she\\r\\npainted Sir Charles, on calm days on deck, in all possible\\r\\nattitudes. She seemed to find him a most attractive model.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor, too, was a precious clever fellow. He knew something of\\r\\nchemistry--and of most other subjects, including, as I gathered, the\\r\\nhuman character. For he talked to Charles about various ideas of\\r\\nhis, with which he wished to \"liven up folks in Kentucky a bit,\" on\\r\\nhis return, till Charles conceived the highest possible regard for\\r\\nhis intelligence and enterprise. \"That\\'s a go-ahead fellow, Sey!\"\\r\\nhe remarked to me one day. \"Has the right sort of grit in him!\\r\\nThose Americans are the men. Wish I had a round hundred of them on\\r\\nmy works in South Africa!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat idea seemed to grow upon him. He was immensely taken with it.\\r\\nHe had lately dismissed one of his chief superintendents at the\\r\\nCloetedorp mine, and he seriously debated whether or not he should\\r\\noffer the post to the smart Kentuckian. For my own part, I am\\r\\ninclined to connect this fact with his expressed determination to\\r\\nvisit his South African undertakings for three months yearly in\\r\\nfuture; and I am driven to suspect he felt life at Cloetedorp would\\r\\nbe rendered much more tolerable by the agreeable society of a quaint\\r\\nand amusing American lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If you offer it to him,\" I said, \"remember, you must disclose your\\r\\npersonality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" Charles answered. \"I can keep it dark for the present,\\r\\ntill all is arranged for. I need only say I have interests in South\\r\\nAfrica.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, one morning on deck, as we were approaching the Banks, he\\r\\nbroached his scheme gently to the doctor and Mrs. Quackenboss. He\\r\\nremarked that he was connected with one of the biggest financial\\r\\nconcerns in the Southern hemisphere; and that he would pay Elihu\\r\\nfifteen hundred a year to represent him at the diggings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What, dollars?\" the lady said, smiling and accentuating the\\r\\ntip-tilted nose a little more. \"Oh, Mr. Porter, it ain\\'t good\\r\\nenough!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, pounds, my dear madam,\" Charles responded. \"Pounds sterling,\\r\\nyou know. In United States currency, seven thousand five hundred.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess Elihu would just jump at it,\" Mrs. Quackenboss replied,\\r\\nlooking at him quizzically.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor laughed. \"You make a good bid, sir,\" he said, in his slow\\r\\nAmerican way, emphasising all the most unimportant words: \"_But_ you\\r\\noverlook one element. I _am_ a man of science, not a speculator. I\\r\\n_have_ trained myself for medical work, _at_ considerable cost, _in_\\r\\nthe best schools of Europe, _and_ I do not propose _to_ fling away\\r\\nthe results _of_ much arduous labour _by_ throwing myself out\\r\\nelastically _into_ a new line of work _for_ which my faculties _may_\\r\\nnot perhaps equally adapt me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(\"How thoroughly American!\" I murmured, in the background.)\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles insisted; all in vain. Mrs. Quackenboss was impressed; but\\r\\nthe doctor smiled always a sphinx-like smile, and reiterated his\\r\\nbelief in the unfitness of mid-stream as an ideal place for swopping\\r\\nhorses. The more he declined, and the better he talked, the more\\r\\neager Charles became each day to secure him. And, as if on purpose\\r\\nto draw him on, the doctor each day gave more and more surprising\\r\\nproofs of his practical abilities. \"I _am_ not a specialist,\" he said.\\r\\n\"I just ketch the drift, appropriate the kernel, _and_ let the rest\\r\\nslide.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe could do anything, it really seemed, from shoeing a mule to\\r\\nconducting a camp-meeting; he was a capital chemist, a very sound\\r\\nsurgeon, a fair judge of horseflesh, a first class euchre player,\\r\\nand a pleasing baritone. When occasion demanded he could occupy a\\r\\npulpit. He had invented a cork-screw which brought him in a small\\r\\nrevenue; and he was now engaged in the translation of a Polish work\\r\\non the \"Application of Hydrocyanic Acid to the Cure of Leprosy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, we reached New York without having got any nearer our goal,\\r\\nas regarded Dr. Quackenboss. He came to bid us good-bye at the quay,\\r\\nwith that sphinx-like smile still playing upon his features. Charles\\r\\nclutched the dispatch-box with one hand, and Mrs. Quackenboss\\'s\\r\\nlittle palm with the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Don\\'t_ tell us,\" he said, \"this is good-bye--for ever!\" And his\\r\\nvoice quite faltered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I guess so, Mr. Porter,\" the pretty American replied, with a\\r\\ntelling glance. \"What hotel do you patronise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Murray Hill,\" Charles responded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh my, ain\\'t that odd?\" Mrs. Quackenboss echoed. \"The Murray Hill!\\r\\nWhy, that\\'s just where we\\'re going too, Elihu!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe upshot of which was that Charles persuaded them, before\\r\\nreturning to Kentucky, to diverge for a few days with us to Lake\\r\\nGeorge and Lake Champlain, where he hoped to over-persuade the\\r\\nrecalcitrant doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Lake George therefore we went, and stopped at the excellent hotel\\r\\nat the terminus of the railway. We spent a good deal of our time on\\r\\nthe light little steamers that ply between that point and the road\\r\\nto Ticonderoga. Somehow, the mountains mirrored in the deep green\\r\\nwater reminded me of Lucerne; and Lucerne reminded me of the little\\r\\ncurate. For the first time since we left England a vague terror\\r\\nseized me. _Could_ Elihu Quackenboss be Colonel Clay again, still\\r\\ndogging our steps through the opposite continent?\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help mentioning my suspicion to Charles--who, strange\\r\\nto say, pooh-poohed it. He had been paying great court to Mrs.\\r\\nQuackenboss that day, and was absurdly elated because the little\\r\\nAmerican had rapped his knuckles with her fan and called him \"a\\r\\nreal silly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, however, an odd thing occurred. We strolled out together,\\r\\nall four of us, along the banks of the lake, among woods just\\r\\ncarpeted with strange, triangular flowers--trilliums, Mrs.\\r\\nQuackenboss called them--and lined with delicate ferns in the\\r\\nfirst green of springtide.\\r\\n\\r\\nI began to grow poetical. (I wrote verses in my youth before I went\\r\\nto South Africa.) We threw ourselves on the grass, near a small\\r\\nmountain stream that descended among moss-clad boulders from the\\r\\nsteep woods above us. The Kentuckian flung himself at full length\\r\\non the sward, just in front of Charles. He had a strange head of\\r\\nhair, very thick and shaggy. I don\\'t know why, but, of a sudden, it\\r\\nreminded me of the Mexican Seer, whom we had learned to remember as\\r\\nColonel Clay\\'s first embodiment. At the same moment the same thought\\r\\nseemed to run through Charles\\'s head; for, strange to say, with\\r\\na quick impulse he leant forward and examined it. I saw Mrs.\\r\\nQuackenboss draw back in wonder. The hair looked too thick and close\\r\\nfor nature. It ended abruptly, I now remembered, with a sharp line\\r\\non the forehead. Could this, too, be a wig? It seemed very probable.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as I thought that thought, Charles appeared to form a sudden\\r\\nand resolute determination. With one lightning swoop he seized the\\r\\ndoctor\\'s hair in his powerful hand, and tried to lift it off bodily.\\r\\nHe had made a bad guess. Next instant the doctor uttered a loud and\\r\\nterrified howl of pain, while several of his hairs, root and all,\\r\\ncame out of his scalp in Charles\\'s hand, leaving a few drops of\\r\\nblood on the skin of the head in the place they were torn from.\\r\\nThere was no doubt at all it was not a wig, but the Kentuckian\\'s\\r\\nnatural hirsute covering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scene that ensued I am powerless to describe. My pen is unequal\\r\\nto it. The doctor arose, not so much angry as astonished, white and\\r\\nincredulous. \"What did you do that for, any way?\" he asked, glaring\\r\\nfiercely at my brother-in-law. Charles was all abject apology. He\\r\\nbegan by profusely expressing his regret, and offering to make any\\r\\nsuitable reparation, monetary or otherwise. Then he revealed his\\r\\nwhole hand. He admitted that he was Sir Charles Vandrift, the famous\\r\\nmillionaire, and that he had suffered egregiously from the endless\\r\\nmachinations of a certain Colonel Clay, a machiavellian rogue,\\r\\nwho had hounded him relentlessly round the capitals of Europe. He\\r\\ndescribed in graphic detail how the impostor got himself up with\\r\\nwigs and wax, so as to deceive even those who knew him intimately;\\r\\nand then he threw himself on Dr. Quackenboss\\'s mercy, as a man who\\r\\nhad been cruelly taken in so often that he could not help suspecting\\r\\nthe best of men falsely. Mrs. Quackenboss admitted it was natural to\\r\\nhave suspicions--\"Especially,\" she said, with candour, \"as you\\'re\\r\\nnot the first to observe the notable way Elihu\\'s hair seems to\\r\\noriginate from his forehead,\" and she pulled it up to show us. But\\r\\nElihu himself sulked on in the dumps: his dignity was offended.\\r\\n\"_If_ you wanted to know,\" he said, \"you might as well have asked me.\\r\\nAssault _and_ battery _is_ not the right way to test whether _a_\\r\\ncitizen\\'s hair is primitive or acquired.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was an impulse,\" Charles pleaded; \"an instinctive impulse!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Civilised man restrains his impulses,\" the doctor answered. \"You\\r\\n_have_ lived too long _in_ South Africa, Mr. Porter--I mean, Sir\\r\\nCharles Vandrift, if that\\'s the right way _to_ address such a\\r\\ngentleman. You appear to _have_ imbibed the habits _and_ manners\\r\\nof the Kaffirs you lived among.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next two days, I will really admit, Charles seemed more\\r\\nwretched than I could have believed it possible for him to be on\\r\\nsomebody else\\'s account. He positively grovelled. The fact was,\\r\\nhe saw he had hurt Dr. Quackenboss\\'s feelings, and--much to my\\r\\nsurprise--he seemed truly grieved at it. If the doctor would have\\r\\naccepted a thousand pounds down to shake hands at once and forget\\r\\nthe incident--in my opinion Charles would have gladly paid it.\\r\\nIndeed, he said as much in other words to the pretty American--for\\r\\nhe could not insult her by offering her money. Mrs. Quackenboss did\\r\\nher best to make it up, for she was a kindly little creature, in\\r\\nspite of her roguishness; but Elihu stood aloof. Charles urged him\\r\\nstill to go out to South Africa, increasing his bait to two thousand\\r\\na year; yet the doctor was immovable. \"No, no,\" he said; \"I had half\\r\\ndecided _to_ accept your offer--_till_ that unfortunate impulse; but\\r\\nthat settled the question. _As_ an American citizen, I decline _to_\\r\\nbecome the representative _of_ a British nobleman who takes such means\\r\\n_of_ investigating questions which affect the hair and happiness _of_\\r\\nhis fellow-creatures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know whether Charles was most disappointed at missing the\\r\\nchance of so clever a superintendent for the mine at Cloetedorp, or\\r\\nelated at the novel description of himself as \"a British nobleman;\"\\r\\nwhich is not precisely our English idea of a colonial knighthood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree days later, accordingly, the Quackenbosses left the Lakeside\\r\\nHotel. We were bound on an expedition up the lake ourselves, when\\r\\nthe pretty little woman burst in with a dash to tell us they were\\r\\nleaving. She was charmingly got up in the neatest and completest of\\r\\nAmerican travelling-dresses. Charles held her hand affectionately.\\r\\n\"I\\'m sorry it\\'s good-bye,\" he said. \"I have done my best to secure\\r\\nyour husband.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You couldn\\'t have tried harder than I did,\" the little woman\\r\\nanswered, and the tip-tilted nose looked quite pathetic; \"for I just\\r\\nhate to be buried right down there in Kentucky! However, Elihu is\\r\\nthe sort of man a woman can neither drive nor lead; so we\\'ve got to\\r\\nput up with him.\" And she smiled upon us sweetly, and disappeared\\r\\nfor ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was disconsolate all that day. Next morning he rose, and\\r\\nannounced his intention of setting out for the West on his tour of\\r\\ninspection. He would recreate by revelling in Colorado silver lodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe packed our own portmanteaus, for Charles had not brought even\\r\\nSimpson with him, and then we prepared to set out by the morning\\r\\ntrain for Saratoga.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp till almost the last moment Charles nursed his dispatch-box.\\r\\nBut as the \"baggage-smashers\" were taking down our luggage, and a\\r\\nchambermaid was lounging officiously about in search of a tip,\\r\\nhe laid it down for a second or two on the centre table while he\\r\\ncollected his other immediate impedimenta. He couldn\\'t find his\\r\\ncigarette-case, and went back to the bedroom for it. I helped\\r\\nhim hunt, but it had disappeared mysteriously. That moment lost\\r\\nhim. When we had found the cigarette-case, and returned to the\\r\\nsitting-room--lo, and behold! the dispatch-box was missing!\\r\\nCharles questioned the servants, but none of them had noticed it.\\r\\nHe searched round the room--not a trace of it anywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, I laid it down here just two minutes ago!\" he cried. But it\\r\\nwas not forthcoming.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'ll turn up in time,\" I said. \"Everything turns up in the\\r\\nend--including Mrs. Quackenboss\\'s nose.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seymour,\" said my brother-in-law, \"your hilarity is inopportune.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo say the truth, Charles was beside himself with anger. He took\\r\\nthe elevator down to the \"Bureau,\" as they call it, and complained\\r\\nto the manager. The manager, a sharp-faced New Yorker, smiled as\\r\\nhe remarked in a nonchalant way that guests with valuables were\\r\\nrequired to leave them in charge of the management, in which case\\r\\nthey were locked up in the safe and duly returned to the depositor\\r\\non leaving. Charles declared somewhat excitedly that he had been\\r\\nrobbed, and demanded that nobody should be allowed to leave the\\r\\nhotel till the dispatch-box was discovered. The manager, quite cool,\\r\\nand obtrusively picking his teeth, responded that such tactics might\\r\\nbe possible in an hotel of the European size, putting up a couple\\r\\nof hundred guests or so; but that an American house, with over a\\r\\nthousand visitors--many of whom came and went daily--could not\\r\\nundertake such a quixotic quest on behalf of a single foreign\\r\\ncomplainant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat epithet, \"foreign,\" stung Charles to the quick. No Englishman\\r\\ncan admit that he is anywhere a foreigner. \"Do you know who I am,\\r\\nsir?\" he asked, angrily. \"I am Sir Charles Vandrift, of London--a\\r\\nmember of the English Parliament.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You may be the Prince of Wales,\" the man answered, \"for all I care.\\r\\nYou\\'ll get the same treatment as anyone else, in America. But if\\r\\nyou\\'re Sir Charles Vandrift,\" he went on, examining his books, \"how\\r\\ndoes it come you\\'ve registered as Mr. Peter Porter?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles grew red with embarrassment. The difficulty deepened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dispatch-box, always covered with a leather case, bore on its\\r\\ninner lid the name \"Sir Charles Vandrift, K.C.M.G.,\" distinctly\\r\\npainted in the orthodox white letters. This was a painful\\r\\ncontretemps: he had lost his precious documents; he had given a\\r\\nfalse name; and he had rendered the manager supremely careless\\r\\nwhether or not he recovered his stolen property. Indeed, seeing he\\r\\nhad registered as Porter, and now \"claimed\" as Vandrift, the manager\\r\\nhinted in pretty plain language he very much doubted whether there\\r\\nhad ever been a dispatch-box in the matter at all, or whether, if\\r\\nthere were one, it had ever contained any valuable documents.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent a wretched morning. Charles went round the hotel,\\r\\nquestioning everybody as to whether they had seen his dispatch-box.\\r\\nMost of the visitors resented the question as a personal imputation;\\r\\none fiery Virginian, indeed, wanted to settle the point then and\\r\\nthere with a six-shooter. Charles telegraphed to New York to prevent\\r\\nthe shares and coupons from being negotiated; but his brokers\\r\\ntelegraphed back that, though they had stopped the numbers as far\\r\\nas possible, they did so with reluctance, as they were not aware of\\r\\nSir Charles Vandrift being now in the country. Charles declared he\\r\\nwouldn\\'t leave the hotel till he recovered his property; and for\\r\\nmyself, I was inclined to suppose we would have to remain there\\r\\naccordingly for the term of our natural lives--and longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night again we spent at the Lakeside Hotel. In the small hours\\r\\nof the morning, as I lay awake and meditated, a thought broke\\r\\nacross me. I was so excited by it that I rose and rushed into my\\r\\nbrother-in-law\\'s bedroom. \"Charles, Charles!\" I exclaimed, \"we have\\r\\ntaken too much for granted once more. Perhaps Elihu Quackenboss\\r\\ncarried off your dispatch-box!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You fool,\" Charles answered, in his most unamiable manner (he\\r\\napplies that word to me with increasing frequency); \"is _that_ what\\r\\nyou\\'ve waked me up for? Why, the Quackenbosses left Lake George\\r\\non Tuesday morning, and I had the dispatch-box in my own hands\\r\\non Wednesday.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have only their word for it,\" I cried. \"Perhaps they stopped\\r\\non--and walked off with it afterwards!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will inquire to-morrow,\" Charles answered. \"But I confess I\\r\\ndon\\'t think it was worth waking me up for. I could stake my life\\r\\non that little woman\\'s integrity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe _did_ inquire next morning--with this curious result: it turned\\r\\nout that, though the Quackenbosses had left the Lakeside Hotel on\\r\\nTuesday, it was only for the neighbouring Washington House, which\\r\\nthey quitted on Wednesday morning, taking the same train for\\r\\nSaratoga which Charles and I had intended to go by. Mrs. Quackenboss\\r\\ncarried a small brown paper parcel in her hands--in which, under the\\r\\ncircumstances, we had little difficulty in recognising Charles\\'s\\r\\ndispatch-box, loosely enveloped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I knew how it was done. The chambermaid, loitering about the\\r\\nroom for a tip, was--Mrs. Quackenboss! It needed but an apron to\\r\\ntransform her pretty travelling-dress into a chambermaid\\'s costume;\\r\\nand in any of those huge American hotels one chambermaid more or\\r\\nless would pass in the crowd without fear of challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We will follow them on to Saratoga,\" Charles cried. \"Pay the bill\\r\\nat once, Seymour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Certainly,\" I answered. \"Will you give me some money?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles clapped his hand to his pockets. \"All, all in the\\r\\ndispatch-box,\" he murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat tied us up another day, till we could get some ready cash from\\r\\nour agents in New York; for the manager, already most suspicious at\\r\\nthe change of name and the accusation of theft, peremptorily refused\\r\\nto accept Charles\\'s cheque, or anything else, as he phrased it,\\r\\nexcept \"hard money.\" So we lingered on perforce at Lake George in\\r\\nignoble inaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of course,\" I observed to my brother-in-law that evening, \"Elihu\\r\\nQuackenboss was Colonel Clay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I suppose so,\" Charles murmured resignedly. \"Everybody I meet seems\\r\\nto be Colonel Clay nowadays--except when I believe they _are_, in\\r\\nwhich case they turn out to be harmless nobodies. But who would have\\r\\nthought it was he after I pulled his hair out? Or after he persisted\\r\\nin his trick, even when I suspected him--which, he told us at\\r\\nSeldon, was against his first principles?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA light dawned upon me again. But, warned by previous ebullitions,\\r\\nI expressed myself this time with becoming timidity. \"Charles,\"\\r\\nI suggested, \"may we not here again have been the slaves of a\\r\\npreconception? We thought Forbes-Gaskell was Colonel Clay--for\\r\\nno better reason than because he wore a wig. We thought Elihu\\r\\nQuackenboss wasn\\'t Colonel Clay--for no better reason than because\\r\\nhe didn\\'t wear one. But how do we know he _ever_ wears wigs? Isn\\'t it\\r\\npossible, after all, that those hints he gave us about make-up, when\\r\\nhe was Medhurst the detective, were framed on purpose, so as to\\r\\nmislead and deceive us? And isn\\'t it possible what he said of his\\r\\nmethods at the Seamew\\'s island that day was similarly designed in\\r\\norder to hoodwink us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That is so obvious, Sey,\" my brother-in-law observed, in a most\\r\\naggrieved tone, \"that I should have thought any secretary worth his\\r\\nsalt would have arrived at it instantly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI abstained from remarking that Charles himself had not arrived at\\r\\nit even now, until I told him. I thought that to say so would serve\\r\\nno good purpose. So I merely went on: \"Well, it seems to me likely\\r\\nthat when he came as Medhurst, with his hair cut short, he was\\r\\nreally wearing his own natural crop, in its simplest form and of\\r\\nits native hue. By now it has had time to grow long and bushy. When\\r\\nhe was David Granton, no doubt, he clipped it to an intermediate\\r\\nlength, trimmed his beard and moustache, and dyed them all red, to\\r\\na fine Scotch colour. As the Seer, again, he wore his hair much\\r\\nthe same as Elihu\\'s; only, to suit the character, more combed and\\r\\nfluffy. As the little curate, he darkened it and plastered it down.\\r\\nAs Von Lebenstein, he shaved close, but cultivated his moustache to\\r\\nits utmost dimensions, and dyed it black after the Tyrolese fashion.\\r\\nHe need never have had a wig; his own natural hair would throughout\\r\\nhave been sufficient, allowing for intervals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You\\'re right, Sey,\" my brother-in-law said, growing almost\\r\\nfriendly. \"I will do you the justice to admit that\\'s the nearest\\r\\nthing we have yet struck out to an idea for tracking him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Saturday morning a letter arrived which relieved us a little\\r\\nfrom our momentary tension. It was from our enemy himself--but most\\r\\ndifferent in tone from his previous bantering communications:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Saratoga, Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"SIR CHARLES VANDRIFT--Herewith I return your dispatch-box,\\r\\nintact, with the papers untouched. As you will readily observe,\\r\\nit has not even been opened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will ask me the reason for this strange conduct. Let me be\\r\\nserious for once, and tell you truthfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"White Heather and I (for I will stick to Mr. Wentworth\\'s\\r\\njudicious sobriquet) came over on the Etruria with you,\\r\\nintending, as usual, to make something out of you. We followed\\r\\nyou to Lake George--for I had \\'forced a card,\\' after my\\r\\nhabitual plan, by inducing you to invite us, with the fixed\\r\\nintention of playing a particular trick upon you. It formed no\\r\\npart of our original game to steal your dispatch-box; that I\\r\\nconsider a simple and elementary trick unworthy the skill of a\\r\\npractised operator. We persisted in the preparations for our\\r\\ncoup, till you pulled my hair out. Then, to my great surprise,\\r\\nI saw you exhibited a degree of regret and genuine compunction\\r\\nwith which, till that moment, I could never have credited you.\\r\\nYou thought you had hurt my feelings; and you behaved more\\r\\nlike a gentleman than I had previously known you to do. You\\r\\nnot only apologised, but you also endeavoured voluntarily to\\r\\nmake reparation. That produced an effect upon me. You may not\\r\\nbelieve it, but I desisted accordingly from the trick I had\\r\\nprepared for you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I might also have accepted your offer to go to South Africa,\\r\\nwhere I could soon have cleared out, having embezzled thousands.\\r\\nBut, then, I should have been in a position of trust and\\r\\nresponsibility--and I am not _quite_ rogue enough to rob you\\r\\nunder those conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever else I am, however, I am not a hypocrite. I do\\r\\nnot pretend to be anything more than a common swindler. If\\r\\nI return you your papers intact, it is only on the same\\r\\nprinciple as that of the Australian bushranger, who made a\\r\\nlady _a present_ of her own watch because she had sung to him\\r\\nand reminded him of England. In other words, he did not take\\r\\nit from her. In like manner, when I found you had behaved, for\\r\\nonce, like a gentleman, contrary to my expectation, I declined\\r\\nto go on with the trick I then meditated. Which does not mean\\r\\nto say I may not hereafter play you some other. _That_ will\\r\\ndepend upon your future good behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, then, did I get White Heather to purloin your dispatch-box,\\r\\nwith intent to return it? Out of pure lightness of heart? Not\\r\\nso; but in order to let you see I really meant it. If I had\\r\\ngone off with no swag, and then written you this letter, you\\r\\nwould not have believed me. You would have thought it was\\r\\nmerely another of my failures. But when I have actually got\\r\\nall your papers into my hands, and give them up again of my\\r\\nown free will, you must see that I mean it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I will end, as I began, seriously. My trade has not quite\\r\\ncrushed out of me all germs or relics of better feeling; and\\r\\nwhen I see a millionaire behave like a man, I feel ashamed\\r\\nto take advantage of that gleam of manliness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yours, with a tinge of penitence, but still a rogue, CUTHBERT CLAY.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing Charles did on receiving this strange communication\\r\\nwas to bolt downstairs and inquire for the dispatch-box. It had\\r\\njust arrived by Eagle Express Company. Charles rushed up to our\\r\\nrooms again, opened it feverishly, and counted his documents. When\\r\\nhe found them all safe, he turned to me with a hard smile. \"This\\r\\nletter,\" he said, with quivering lips, \"I consider still more\\r\\ninsulting than all his previous ones.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, for myself, I really thought there was a ring of truth about\\r\\nit. Colonel Clay was a rogue, no doubt--a most unblushing rogue;\\r\\nbut even a rogue, I believe, has his better moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the phrase about the \"position of trust and responsibility\"\\r\\ntouched Charles to the quick, I suppose, in re the Slump in\\r\\nCloetedorp Golcondas. Though, to be sure, it was a hit at me as\\r\\nwell, over the ten per cent commission.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE GAME OF POKER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seymour,\" my brother-in-law said, with a deep-drawn sigh, as we\\r\\nleft Lake George next day by the Rennselaer and Saratoga Railroad,\\r\\n\"no more Peter Porter for me, _if_ you please! I\\'m sick of disguises.\\r\\nNow that we know Colonel Clay is here in America, they serve no\\r\\ngood purpose; so I may as well receive the social consideration and\\r\\nproper respect to which my rank and position naturally entitle me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And which they secure for the most part (except from hotel clerks),\\r\\neven in this republican land,\" I answered briskly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor in my humble opinion, for sound copper-bottomed snobbery,\\r\\nregistered A1 at Lloyd\\'s, give _me_ the free-born American citizen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe travelled through the States, accordingly, for the next four\\r\\nmonths, from Maine to California, and from Oregon to Florida,\\r\\nunder our own true names, \"Confirming the churches,\" as Charles\\r\\nfacetiously put it--or in other words, looking into the management\\r\\nand control of railways, syndicates, mines, and cattle-ranches. We\\r\\ninquired about everything. And the result of our investigations\\r\\nappeared to be, as Charles further remarked, that the Sabeans who\\r\\nso troubled the sons of Job seemed to have migrated in a body to\\r\\nKansas and Nebraska, and that several thousand head of cattle seemed\\r\\nmysteriously to vanish, \\xc3\\xa0 la Colonel Clay, into the pure air of the\\r\\nprairies just before each branding.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, we were fortunate in avoiding the incursions of the Colonel\\r\\nhimself, who must have migrated meanwhile on some enchanted carpet\\r\\nto other happy hunting-grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was chill October before we found ourselves safe back in New\\r\\nYork, en route for England. So long a term of freedom from the\\r\\nColonel\\'s depredations (as Charles fondly imagined--but I will not\\r\\nanticipate) had done my brother-in-law\\'s health and spirits a world\\r\\nof good; he was so lively and cheerful that he began to fancy his\\r\\ntormentor must have succumbed to yellow fever, then raging in New\\r\\nOrleans, or eaten himself ill, as we nearly did ourselves, on a\\r\\ngenerous mixture of clam-chowder, terrapin, soft-shelled crabs,\\r\\nJersey peaches, canvas-backed ducks, Catawba wine, winter cherries,\\r\\nbrandy cocktails, strawberry-shortcake, ice-creams, corn-dodger,\\r\\nand a judicious brew commonly known as a Colorado corpse-reviver.\\r\\nHowever that may be, Charles returned to New York in excellent\\r\\ntrim; and, dreading in that great city the wiles of his antagonist,\\r\\nhe cheerfully accepted the invitation of his brother millionaire,\\r\\nSenator Wrengold of Nevada, to spend a few days before sailing in\\r\\nthe Senator\\'s magnificent and newly-finished palace at the upper\\r\\nend of Fifth Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There, at least, I shall be safe, Sey,\" he said to me plaintively,\\r\\nwith a weary smile. \"Wrengold, at any rate, won\\'t try to take me\\r\\nin--except, of course, in the regular way of business.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBoss-Nugget Hall (as it is popularly christened) is perhaps the\\r\\nhandsomest brown stone mansion in the Richardsonian style on all\\r\\nFifth Avenue. We spent a delightful week there. The lines had fallen\\r\\nto us in pleasant places. On the night we arrived Wrengold gave\\r\\na small bachelor party in our honour. He knew Sir Charles was\\r\\ntravelling without Lady Vandrift, and rightly judged he would prefer\\r\\non his first night an informal party, with cards and cigars, instead\\r\\nof being bothered with the charming, but still somewhat hampering\\r\\naddition of female society.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guests that evening were no more than seven, all told, ourselves\\r\\nincluded--making up, Wrengold said, that perfect number, an octave.\\r\\nHe was a nouveau riche himself--the newest of the new--commonly\\r\\nknown in exclusive old-fashioned New York society as the Gilded\\r\\nSquatter; for he \"struck his reef\" no more than ten years ago; and\\r\\nhe was therefore doubly anxious, after the American style, to be\\r\\n\"just dizzy with culture.\" In his capacity of M\\xc3\\xa6cenas, he had\\r\\ninvited amongst others the latest of English literary arrivals in\\r\\nNew York--Mr. Algernon Coleyard, the famous poet, and leader of the\\r\\nBriar-rose school of West-country fiction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You know him in London, of course?\" he observed to Charles, with\\r\\na smile, as we waited dinner for our guests.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" Charles answered stolidly. \"I have not had that honour.\\r\\nWe move, you see, in different circles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI observed by a curious shade which passed over Senator Wrengold\\'s\\r\\nface that he quite misapprehended my brother-in-law\\'s meaning.\\r\\nCharles wished to convey, of course, that Mr. Coleyard belonged to\\r\\na mere literary and Bohemian set in London, while he himself moved\\r\\non a more exalted plane of peers and politicians. But the Senator,\\r\\nbetter accustomed to the new-rich point of view, understood Charles\\r\\nto mean that _he_ had not the entr\\xc3\\xa9e of that distinguished coterie in\\r\\nwhich Mr. Coleyard posed as a shining luminary. Which naturally\\r\\nmade him rate even higher than before his literary acquisition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt two minutes past the hour the poet entered. Even if we had not\\r\\nbeen already familiar with his portrait at all ages in The Strand\\r\\nMagazine, we should have recognised him at once for a genuine bard\\r\\nby his impassioned eyes, his delicate mouth, the artistic twirl of\\r\\none gray lock upon his expansive brow, the grizzled moustache that\\r\\ngave point and force to the genial smile, and the two white rows of\\r\\nperfect teeth behind it. Most of our fellow-guests had met Coleyard\\r\\nbefore at a reception given by the Lotus Club that afternoon, for\\r\\nthe bard had reached New York but the previous evening; so Charles\\r\\nand I were the only visitors who remained to be introduced to him.\\r\\nThe lion of the hour was attired in ordinary evening dress, with\\r\\nno foppery of any kind, but he wore in his buttonhole a dainty\\r\\nblue flower whose name I do not know; and as he bowed distantly to\\r\\nCharles, whom he surveyed through his eyeglass, the gleam of a big\\r\\ndiamond in the middle of his shirt-front betrayed the fact that the\\r\\nBriar-rose school, as it was called (from his famous epic), had at\\r\\nleast succeeded in making money out of poetry. He explained to us a\\r\\nlittle later, in fact, that he was over in New York to look after\\r\\nhis royalties. \"The beggars,\" he said, \"only gave me eight hundred\\r\\npounds on my last volume. I couldn\\'t stand _that_, you know; for a\\r\\nmodern bard, moving with the age, can only sing when duly wound up;\\r\\nso I\\'ve run across to investigate. Put a penny in the slot, don\\'t\\r\\nyou see, and the poet will pipe for you.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly like myself,\" Charles said, finding a point in common.\\r\\n\"_I\\'m_ interested in mines; and I, too, have come over to look\\r\\nafter my royalties.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poet placed his eyeglass in his eye once more, and surveyed\\r\\nCharles deliberately from head to foot. \"Oh,\" he murmured slowly. He\\r\\nsaid not a word more; but somehow, everybody felt that Charles was\\r\\ndemolished. I saw that Wrengold, when we went in to dinner, hastily\\r\\naltered the cards that marked their places. He had evidently put\\r\\nCharles at first to sit next the poet; he varied that arrangement\\r\\nnow, setting Algernon Coleyard between a railway king and a magazine\\r\\neditor. I have seldom seen my respected brother-in-law so completely\\r\\nsilenced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poet\\'s conduct during dinner was most peculiar. He kept quoting\\r\\npoetry at inopportune moments.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Roast lamb or boiled turkey, sir?\" said the footman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mary had a little lamb,\" said the poet. \"I shall imitate Mary.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles and the Senator thought the remark undignified.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter dinner, however, under the mellowing influence of some\\r\\nexcellent Roederer, Charles began to expand again, and grew lively\\r\\nand anecdotal. The poet had made us all laugh not a little with\\r\\nvarious capital stories of London literary society--at least two of\\r\\nthem, I think, new ones; and Charles was moved by generous emulation\\r\\nto contribute his own share to the amusement of the company. He was\\r\\nin excellent cue. He is not often brilliant; but when he chooses, he\\r\\nhas a certain dry vein of caustic humour which is decidedly funny,\\r\\nthough not perhaps strictly without being vulgar. On this particular\\r\\nnight, then, warmed with the admirable Wrengold champagne--the\\r\\nbest made in America--he launched out into a full and embroidered\\r\\ndescription of the various ways in which Colonel Clay had deceived\\r\\nhim. I will not say that he narrated them in full with the same\\r\\nfrankness and accuracy that I have shown in these pages; he\\r\\nsuppressed not a few of the most amusing details--on no other\\r\\nground, apparently, than because they happened to tell against\\r\\nhimself; and he enlarged a good deal on the surprising cleverness\\r\\nwith which several times he had nearly secured his man; but still,\\r\\nmaking all allowances for native vanity in concealment and addition,\\r\\nhe was distinctly funny--he represented the matter for once in its\\r\\nludicrous rather than in its disastrous aspect. He observed also,\\r\\nlooking around the table, that after all he had lost less by\\r\\nColonel Clay in four years of persecution than he often lost by\\r\\none injudicious move in a single day on the London Stock Exchange;\\r\\nwhile he seemed to imply to the solid men of New York, that he\\r\\nwould cheerfully sacrifice such a fleabite as that, in return for\\r\\nthe amusement and excitement of the chase which the Colonel had\\r\\nafforded him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poet was pleased. \"You are a man of spirit, Sir Charles,\" he\\r\\nsaid. \"I love to see this fine old English admiration of pluck and\\r\\nadventure! The fellow must really have some good in him, after all.\\r\\nI should like to take notes of a few of those stories; they would\\r\\nsupply nice material for basing a romance upon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I hardly know whether I\\'m exactly the man to make the hero of a\\r\\nnovel,\" Charles murmured, with complacence. And he certainly didn\\'t\\r\\nlook it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_I_ was thinking rather of Colonel Clay as the hero,\" the poet\\r\\nresponded coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, that\\'s the way with you men of letters,\" Charles answered,\\r\\ngrowing warm. \"You always have a sneaking sympathy with the rascals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That may be better,\" Coleyard retorted, in an icy voice, \"than\\r\\nsympathy with the worst forms of Stock Exchange speculation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company smiled uneasily. The railway king wriggled. Wrengold\\r\\ntried to change the subject hastily. But Charles would not be put\\r\\ndown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You must hear the end, though,\" he said. \"That\\'s not quite the\\r\\nworst. The meanest thing about the man is that he\\'s also a\\r\\nhypocrite. He wrote me _such_ a letter at the end of his last\\r\\ntrick--here, positively here, in America.\" And he proceeded to give\\r\\nhis own version of the Quackenboss incident, enlivened with sundry\\r\\nimaginative bursts of pure Vandrift fancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Charles spoke of Mrs. Quackenboss the poet smiled. \"The worst\\r\\nof married women,\" he said, \"is--that you can\\'t marry them; the\\r\\nworst of unmarried women is--that they want to marry you.\" But when\\r\\nit came to the letter, the poet\\'s eye was upon my brother-in-law.\\r\\nCharles, I must fain admit, garbled the document sadly. Still, even\\r\\nso, some gleam of good feeling remained in its sentences. But\\r\\nCharles ended all by saying, \"So, to crown his misdemeanours, the\\r\\nrascal shows himself a whining cur and a disgusting Pharisee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you think,\" the poet interposed, in his cultivated drawl, \"he\\r\\nmay have really meant it? Why should not some grain of compunction\\r\\nhave stirred his soul still?--some remnant of conscience made him\\r\\nshrink from betraying a man who confided in him? I have an idea,\\r\\nmyself, that even the worst of rogues have always some good in them.\\r\\nI notice they often succeed to the end in retaining the affection\\r\\nand fidelity of women.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, I said so!\" Charles sneered. \"I told you you literary men have\\r\\nalways an underhand regard for a scoundrel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Perhaps so,\" the poet answered. \"For we are all of us human. Let\\r\\nhim that is without sin among us cast the first stone.\" And then he\\r\\nrelapsed into moody silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe rose from table. Cigars went round. We adjourned to the\\r\\nsmoking-room. It was a Moorish marvel, with Oriental hangings.\\r\\nThere, Senator Wrengold and Charles exchanged reminiscences of\\r\\nbonanzas and ranches and other exciting post-prandial topics; while\\r\\nthe magazine editor cut in now and again with a pertinent inquiry\\r\\nor a quaint and sarcastic parallel instance. It was clear he had an\\r\\neye to future copy. Only Algernon Coleyard sat brooding and silent,\\r\\nwith his chin on one hand, and his brow intent, musing and gazing at\\r\\nthe embers in the fireplace. The hand, by the way, was remarkable\\r\\nfor a curious, antique-looking ring, apparently of Egyptian or\\r\\nEtruscan workmanship, with a projecting gem of several large facets.\\r\\nOnce only, in the midst of a game of whist, he broke out with a\\r\\nsingle comment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hawkins was made an earl,\" said Charles, speaking of some London\\r\\nacquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What for?\" asked the Senator.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Successful adulteration,\" said the poet tartly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Honours are easy,\" the magazine editor put in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And two by tricks to Sir Charles,\" the poet added.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the close of the evening, however--the poet still remaining\\r\\nmoody, not to say positively grumpy--Senator Wrengold proposed a\\r\\nfriendly game of Swedish poker. It was the latest fashionable\\r\\nvariant in Western society on the old gambling round, and few of us\\r\\nknew it, save the omniscient poet and the magazine editor. It turned\\r\\nout afterwards that Wrengold proposed that particular game because\\r\\nhe had heard Coleyard observe at the Lotus Club the same afternoon\\r\\nthat it was a favourite amusement of his. Now, however, for a while\\r\\nhe objected to playing. He was a poor man, he said, and the rest\\r\\nwere all rich; why should he throw away the value of a dozen golden\\r\\nsonnets just to add one more pinnacle to the gilded roofs of a\\r\\nmillionaire\\'s palace? Besides, he was half-way through with an ode\\r\\nhe was inditing to Republican simplicity. The pristine austerity\\r\\nof a democratic senatorial cottage had naturally inspired him with\\r\\nmemories of Dentatus, the Fabii, Camillus. But Wrengold, dimly aware\\r\\nhe was being made fun of somehow, insisted that the poet must take\\r\\na hand with the financiers. \"You can pass, you know,\" he said, \"as\\r\\noften as you like; and you can stake low, or go it blind, according\\r\\nas you\\'re inclined to. It\\'s a democratic game; every man decides for\\r\\nhimself how high he will play, except the banker; and you needn\\'t\\r\\ntake bank unless you want it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, if you insist upon it,\" Coleyard drawled out, with languid\\r\\nreluctance, \"I\\'ll play, of course. I won\\'t spoil your evening.\\r\\nBut remember, I\\'m a poet; I have strange inspirations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cards were \"squeezers\"--that is to say, had the suit and the\\r\\nnumber of pips in each printed small in the corner, as well as over\\r\\nthe face, for ease of reference. We played low at first. The poet\\r\\nseldom staked; and when he did--a few pounds--he lost, with singular\\r\\npersistence. He wanted to play for doubloons or sequins, and could\\r\\nwith difficulty be induced to condescend to dollars. Charles looked\\r\\nacross at him at last; the stakes by that time were fast rising\\r\\nhigher, and we played for ready money. Notes lay thick on the green\\r\\ncloth. \"Well,\" he murmured provokingly, \"how about your inspiration?\\r\\nHas Apollo deserted you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an unwonted flight of classical allusion for Charles, and I\\r\\nconfess it astonished me. (I discovered afterwards he had cribbed\\r\\nit from a review in that evening\\'s Critic.) But the poet smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" he answered calmly, \"I am waiting for one now. When it comes,\\r\\nyou may be sure you shall have the benefit of it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNext round, Charles dealing and banking, the poet staked on his\\r\\ncard, unseen as usual. He staked like a gentleman. To our immense\\r\\nastonishment he pulled out a roll of notes, and remarked, in a quiet\\r\\ntone, \"I have an inspiration now. _Half-hearted_ will do. I go five\\r\\nthousand.\" That was dollars, of course; but it amounted to a\\r\\nthousand pounds in English money--high play for an author.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles smiled and turned his card. The poet turned his--and won\\r\\na thousand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good shot!\" Charles murmured, pretending not to mind, though he\\r\\ndetests losing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Inspiration!\" the poet mused, and looked once more abstracted.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles dealt again. The poet watched the deal with boiled-fishy\\r\\neyes. His thoughts were far away. His lips moved audibly. \"Myrtle,\\r\\nand kirtle, and hurtle,\" he muttered. \"They\\'ll do for three. Then\\r\\nthere\\'s turtle, meaning dove; and that finishes the possible. Laurel\\r\\nand coral make a very bad rhyme. Try myrtle; don\\'t you think so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you stake?\" Charles asked, severely, interrupting his reverie.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poet started. \"No, pass,\" he replied, looking down at his card,\\r\\nand subsided into muttering. We caught a tremor of his lips again,\\r\\nand heard something like this: \"Not less but more republican than\\r\\nthou, Half-hearted watcher by the Western sea, After long years I\\r\\ncome to visit thee, And test thy fealty to that maiden vow, That\\r\\nbound thee in thy budding prime For Freedom\\'s bride--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stake?\" Charles interrupted, inquiringly, again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, five thousand,\" the poet answered dreamily, pushing forward\\r\\nhis pile of notes, and never ceasing from his murmur: \"For Freedom\\'s\\r\\nbride to all succeeding time. Succeeding; succeeding; weak word,\\r\\nsucceeding. Couldn\\'t go five dollars on it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles turned his card once more. The poet had won again. Charles\\r\\npassed over his notes. The poet raked them in with a far-away air,\\r\\nas one who looks at infinity, and asked if he could borrow a pencil\\r\\nand paper. He had a few priceless lines to set down which might\\r\\notherwise escape him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is play,\" Charles said pointedly. \"_Will_ you kindly attend to\\r\\none thing or the other?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poet glanced at him with a compassionate smile. \"I told you I\\r\\nhad inspirations,\" he said. \"They always come together. I can\\'t win\\r\\nyour money as fast as I would like, unless at the same time I am\\r\\nmaking verses. Whenever I hit upon a good epithet, I back my luck,\\r\\ndon\\'t you see? I won a thousand on _half-hearted_ and a thousand on\\r\\n_budding_; if I were to back _succeeding_, I should lose, to a\\r\\ncertainty. You understand my system?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I call it pure rubbish,\" Charles answered. \"However, continue.\\r\\nSystems were made for fools--and to suit wise men. Sooner or later\\r\\nyou _must_ lose at such a stupid fancy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poet continued. \"For Freedom\\'s bride to all _ensuing_ time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stake!\" Charles cried sharply. We each of us staked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_Ensuing_,\" the poet murmured. \"To all _ensuing_ time. First-rate\\r\\nepithet that. I go ten thousand, Sir Charles, on _ensuing_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all turned up. Some of us lost, some won; but the poet had\\r\\nsecured his two thousand sterling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I haven\\'t that amount about me,\" Charles said, in that austerely\\r\\nnettled voice which he always assumes when he loses at cards;\\r\\n\"but--I\\'ll settle it with you to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Another round?\" the host asked, beaming.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, thank you,\" Charles answered; \"Mr. Coleyard\\'s inspirations\\r\\ncome too pat for my taste. His luck beats mine. I retire from the\\r\\ngame, Senator.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust at that moment a servant entered, bearing a salver, with a\\r\\nsmall note in an envelope. \"For Mr. Coleyard,\" he observed; \"and\\r\\nthe messenger said, _urgent_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nColeyard tore it open hurriedly. I could see he was agitated. His\\r\\nface grew white at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I beg your pardon,\" he said. \"I--I must go back instantly. My\\r\\nwife is dangerously ill--quite a sudden attack. Forgive me, Senator.\\r\\nSir Charles, you shall have your revenge to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was clear that his voice faltered. We felt at least he was a man\\r\\nof feeling. He was obviously frightened. His coolness forsook him.\\r\\nHe shook hands as in a dream, and rushed downstairs for his\\r\\ndust-coat. Almost as he closed the front door, a new guest entered,\\r\\njust missing him in the vestibule.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Halloa, you men,\" he said, \"we\\'ve been taken in, do you know? It\\'s\\r\\nall over the Lotus. The man we made an honorary member of the club\\r\\nto-day is _not_ Algernon Coleyard. He\\'s a blatant impostor. There\\'s\\r\\na telegram come in on the tape to-night saying Algernon Coleyard is\\r\\ndangerously ill at his home in England.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles gasped a violent gasp. \"Colonel Clay!\" he shouted, aloud.\\r\\n\"And once more he\\'s done me. There\\'s not a moment to lose. After\\r\\nhim, gentlemen! after him!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNever before in our lives had we had such a close shave of catching\\r\\nand fixing the redoubtable swindler. We burst down the stairs in a\\r\\nbody, and rushed out into Fifth Avenue. The pretended poet had only\\r\\na hundred yards\\' start of us, and he saw he was discovered. But he\\r\\nwas an excellent runner. So was I, weight for age; and I dashed\\r\\nwildly after him. He turned round a corner; it proved to lead\\r\\nnowhere, and lost him time. He darted back again, madly. Delighted\\r\\nwith the idea that I was capturing so famous a criminal, I redoubled\\r\\nmy efforts--and came up with him, panting. He was wearing a light\\r\\ndust-coat. I seized it in my hands. \"I\\'ve got you at last!\" I cried;\\r\\n\"Colonel Clay, I\\'ve got you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned and looked at me. \"Ha, old Ten Per Cent!\" he called out,\\r\\nstruggling. \"It\\'s you, then, is it? Never, never to _you_, sir!\" And\\r\\nas he spoke, he somehow flung his arms straight out behind him, and\\r\\nlet the dust-coat slip off, which it easily did, the sleeves being\\r\\nnew and smoothly silk-lined. The suddenness of the movement threw\\r\\nme completely off my guard, and off my legs as well. I was clinging\\r\\nto the coat and holding him. As the support gave way I rolled over\\r\\nbackward, in the mud of the street, and hurt my back seriously. As\\r\\nfor Colonel Clay, with a nervous laugh, he bolted off at full speed\\r\\nin his evening coat, and vanished round a corner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some seconds before I had sufficiently recovered my breath to\\r\\npick myself up again, and examine my bruises. By this time Charles\\r\\nand the other pursuers had come up, and I explained my condition to\\r\\nthem. Instead of commending me for my zeal in his cause--which had\\r\\ncost me a barked arm and a good evening suit--my brother-in-law\\r\\nremarked, with an unfeeling sneer, that when I had so nearly caught\\r\\nmy man I might as well have held him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have his coat, at least,\" I said. \"That may afford us a clue.\"\\r\\nAnd I limped back with it in my hands, feeling horribly bruised and\\r\\na good deal shaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we came to examine the coat, however, it bore no maker\\'s name;\\r\\nthe strap at the back, where the tailor proclaims with pride his\\r\\nhandicraft, had been carefully ripped off, and its place was taken\\r\\nby a tag of plain black tape without inscription of any sort. We\\r\\nsearched the breast-pocket. A handkerchief, similarly nameless,\\r\\nbut of finest cambric. The side-pockets--ha, what was this? I drew\\r\\na piece of paper out in triumph. It was a note--a real find--the\\r\\none which the servant had handed to our friend just before at the\\r\\nSenator\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe read it through breathlessly:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DARLING PAUL,--I _told_ you it was too dangerous. You should have\\r\\nlistened to me. You ought _never_ to have imitated any real person. I\\r\\nhappened to glance at the hotel tape just now, to see the quotations\\r\\nfor Cloetedorps to-day, and what do you think I read as part of the\\r\\nlatest telegram from England? \\'Mr. Algernon Coleyard, the famous\\r\\npoet, is lying on his death-bed at his home in Devonshire.\\' By this\\r\\ntime all New York knows. Don\\'t stop one minute. Say I\\'m dangerously\\r\\nill, and come away at once. Don\\'t return to the hotel. I am removing\\r\\nour things. Meet me at Mary\\'s. Your devoted, MARGOT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is _very_ important,\" Charles said. \"This _does_ give us a clue.\\r\\nWe know two things now: his real name is Paul--whatever else it may\\r\\nbe, and Madame Picardet\\'s is Margot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI searched the pocket again, and pulled out a ring. Evidently he had\\r\\nthrust these two things there when he saw me pursuing him, and had\\r\\nforgotten or neglected them in the heat of the m\\xc3\\xaal\\xc3\\xa9e.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked at it close. It was the very ring I had noticed on his\\r\\nfinger while he was playing Swedish poker. It had a large compound\\r\\ngem in the centre, set with many facets, and rising like a pyramid\\r\\nto a point in the middle. There were eight faces in all, some of\\r\\nthem composed of emerald, amethyst, or turquoise. But _one_ face--the\\r\\none that turned at a direct angle towards the wearer\\'s eye--was _not_\\r\\na gem at all, but an extremely tiny convex mirror. In a moment I\\r\\nspotted the trick. He held this hand carelessly on the table while\\r\\nmy brother-in-law dealt; and when he saw that the suit and number of\\r\\nhis own card mirrored in it by means of the squeezers were better\\r\\nthan Charles\\'s, he had \"an inspiration,\" and backed his luck--or\\r\\nrather his knowledge--with perfect confidence. I did not doubt,\\r\\neither, that his odd-looking eyeglass was a powerful magnifier which\\r\\nhelped him in the trick. Still, we tried another deal, by way of\\r\\nexperiment--I wearing the ring; and even with the naked eye I was\\r\\nable to distinguish in every case the suit and pips of the card that\\r\\nwas dealt me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, that was almost dishonest,\" the Senator said, drawing back.\\r\\nHe wished to show us that even far-Western speculators drew a line\\r\\nsomewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" the magazine editor echoed. \"To back your skill is legal;\\r\\nto back your luck is foolish; to back your knowledge is--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Immoral,\" I suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good business,\" said the magazine editor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s a simple trick,\" Charles interposed. \"I should have spotted\\r\\nit if it had been done by any other fellow. But his patter about\\r\\ninspiration put me clean off the track. That\\'s the rascal\\'s dodge.\\r\\nHe plays the regular conjurer\\'s game of distracting your attention\\r\\nfrom the real point at issue--so well that you never find out what\\r\\nhe\\'s really about till he\\'s sold you irretrievably.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe set the New York police upon the trail of the Colonel; but of\\r\\ncourse he had vanished at once, as usual, into the thin smoke of\\r\\nManhattan. Not a sign could we find of him. \"Mary\\'s,\" we found an\\r\\ninsufficient address.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe waited on in New York for a whole fortnight. Nothing came of it.\\r\\nWe never found \"Mary\\'s.\" The only token of Colonel Clay\\'s presence\\r\\nvouchsafed us in the city was one of his customary insulting notes.\\r\\nIt was conceived as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O ETERNAL GULLIBLE!--Since I saw you on Lake George, I have run\\r\\nback to London, and promptly come out again. I had business to\\r\\ntransact there, indeed, which I have now completed; the excessive\\r\\nattentions of the English police sent me once more, like great\\r\\nOrion, \"sloping slowly to the west.\" I returned to America in order\\r\\nto see whether or not you were still impenitent. On the day of my\\r\\narrival I happened to meet Senator Wrengold, and accepted his kind\\r\\ninvitation solely that I might see how far my last communication\\r\\nhad had a proper effect upon you. As I found you quite obdurate,\\r\\nand as you furthermore persisted in misunderstanding my motives, I\\r\\ndetermined to read you one more small lesson. It nearly failed; and\\r\\nI confess the accident has affected my nerves a little. I am now\\r\\nabout to retire from business altogether, and settle down for life\\r\\nat my place in Surrey. I mean to try just one more small coup; and,\\r\\nwhen that is finished, Colonel Clay will hang up his sword, like\\r\\nCincinnatus, and take to farming. You need no longer fear me. I have\\r\\nrealised enough to secure me for life a modest competence; and as\\r\\nI am not possessed like yourself with an immoderate greed of gain,\\r\\nI recognise that good citizenship demands of me now an early\\r\\nretirement in favour of some younger and more deserving rascal. I\\r\\nshall always look back with pleasure upon our agreeable adventures\\r\\ntogether; and as you hold my dust-coat, together with a ring and\\r\\nletter to which I attach importance, I consider we are quits, and\\r\\nI shall withdraw with dignity. Your sincere well-wisher, CUTHBERT\\r\\nCLAY, Poet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just like him!\" Charles said, \"to hold this one last coup over my\\r\\nhead in terrorem. Though even when he has played it, why should I\\r\\ntrust his word? A scamp like that may say it, of course, on purpose\\r\\nto disarm me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my own part, I quite agreed with \"Margot.\" When the Colonel was\\r\\nreduced to dressing the part of a known personage I felt he had\\r\\nreached almost his last card, and would be well advised to retire\\r\\ninto Surrey.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the magazine editor summed up all in a word. \"Don\\'t believe\\r\\nthat nonsense about fortunes being made by industry and ability,\"\\r\\nhe said. \"In life, as at cards, two things go to produce\\r\\nsuccess--the first is chance; the second is cheating.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE BERTILLON METHOD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a terrible passage home from New York. The Captain told us he\\r\\n\"knew every drop of water in the Atlantic personally\"; and he had\\r\\nnever seen them so uniformly obstreperous. The ship rolled in the\\r\\ntrough; Charles rolled in his cabin, and would not be comforted. As\\r\\nwe approached the Irish coast, I scrambled up on deck in a violent\\r\\ngale, and retired again somewhat precipitately to announce to my\\r\\nbrother-in-law that we had just come in sight of the Fastnet Rock\\r\\nLighthouse. Charles merely turned over in his berth and groaned.\\r\\n\"I don\\'t believe it,\" he answered. \"I expect it is probably Colonel\\r\\nClay in another of his manifold disguises!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Liverpool, however, the Adelphi consoled him. We dined\\r\\nluxuriously in the Louis Quinze restaurant, as only millionaires\\r\\ncan dine, and proceeded next day by Pullman car to London.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe found Amelia dissolved in tears at a domestic cataclysm. It\\r\\nseemed that C\\xc3\\xa9sarine had given notice.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was scarcely home again when he began to bethink him of\\r\\nthe least among his investments. Like many other wealthy men, my\\r\\nrespected connection is troubled more or less, in the background of\\r\\nhis consciousness, by a pervading dread that he will die a beggar.\\r\\nTo guard against this misfortune--which I am bound to admit nobody\\r\\nelse fears for him--he invested, several years ago, a sum of two\\r\\nhundred thousand pounds in Consols, to serve as a nest-egg in case\\r\\nof the collapse of Golcondas and South Africa generally. It is\\r\\npart of the same amiable mania, too, that he will not allow the\\r\\ndividend-warrants on this sum to be sent to him by post, but\\r\\ninsists, after the fashion of old ladies and country parsons, upon\\r\\ncalling personally at the Bank of England four times a year to claim\\r\\nhis interest. He is well known by sight to not a few of the clerks;\\r\\nand his appearance in Threadneedle Street is looked forward to with\\r\\ngreat regularity within a few weeks of each lawful quarter-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, on the morning after our arrival in town, Charles observed to\\r\\nme, cheerfully, \"Sey, I must run into the City to-day to claim my\\r\\ndividends. There are two quarters owing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI accompanied him in to the Bank. Even that mighty official, the\\r\\nbeadle at the door, unfastened the handle of the millionaire\\'s\\r\\ncarriage. The clerk who received us smiled and nodded. \"How much?\"\\r\\nhe asked, after the stereotyped fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Two hundred thousand,\" Charles answered, looking affable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk turned up the books. \"Paid!\" he said, with\\r\\ndecision. \"What\\'s your game, sir, if I may ask you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Paid!\" Charles echoed, drawing back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk gazed across at him. \"Yes, Sir Charles,\" he answered, in\\r\\na somewhat severe tone. \"You must remember you drew a quarter\\'s\\r\\ndividend from myself--last week--at this very counter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles stared at him fixedly. \"Show me the signature,\" he said at\\r\\nlast, in a slow, dazed fashion. I suspected mischief.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk pushed the book across to him. Charles examined the name\\r\\nclose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Colonel Clay again!\" he cried, turning to me with a despondent air.\\r\\n\"He must have dressed the part. I shall die in the workhouse, Sey!\\r\\nThat man has stolen away even my nest-egg from me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw it at a glance. \"Mrs. Quackenboss!\" I put in. \"Those portraits\\r\\non the Etruria! It was to help him in his make-up! You recollect,\\r\\nshe sketched your face and figure at all possible angles.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And last quarter\\'s?\" Charles inquired, staggering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clerk turned up the entry. \"Drawn on the 10th of July,\"\\r\\nhe answered, carelessly, as if it mattered nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I knew why the Colonel had run across to England.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles positively reeled. \"Take me home, Sey,\" he cried. \"I am\\r\\nruined, ruined! He will leave me with not half a million in the\\r\\nworld. My poor, poor boys will beg their bread, unheeded, through\\r\\nthe streets of London!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(As Amelia has landed estate settled upon her worth a hundred and\\r\\nfifty thousand pounds, this last contingency affected me less to\\r\\ntears than Charles seemed to think necessary.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made all needful inquiries, and put the police upon the quest at\\r\\nonce, as always. But no redress was forthcoming. The money, once\\r\\npaid, could not be recovered. It is a playful little privilege of\\r\\nConsols that the Government declines under any circumstances to pay\\r\\ntwice over. Charles drove back to Mayfair a crushed and broken man.\\r\\nI think if Colonel Clay himself could have seen him just then, he\\r\\nwould have pitied that vast intellect in its grief and bewilderment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter lunch, however, my brother-in-law\\'s natural buoyancy\\r\\nreasserted itself by degrees. He rallied a little. \"Seymour,\" he\\r\\nsaid to me, \"you\\'ve heard, of course, of the Bertillon system of\\r\\nmeasuring and registering criminals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have,\" I answered. \"And it\\'s excellent as far as it goes. But,\\r\\nlike Mrs. Glasse\\'s jugged hare, it all depends upon the initial\\r\\nstep. \\'First catch your criminal.\\' Now, we have never caught\\r\\nColonel Clay--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Or, rather,\" Charles interposed unkindly, \"when you _did_ catch him,\\r\\nyou didn\\'t hold him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI ignored the unkindly suggestion, and continued in the same voice,\\r\\n\"We have never secured Colonel Clay; and until we secure him, we\\r\\ncannot register him by the Bertillon method. Besides, even if we\\r\\nhad once caught him and duly noted the shape of his nose, his chin,\\r\\nhis ears, his forehead, of what use would that be against a man who\\r\\nturns up with a fresh face each time, and can mould his features\\r\\ninto what form he likes, to deceive and foil us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never mind, Sey,\" my brother-in-law said. \"I was told in New York\\r\\nthat Dr. Frank Beddersley, of London, was the best exponent of the\\r\\nBertillon system now living in England; and to Beddersley I shall\\r\\ngo. Or, rather, I\\'ll invite him here to lunch to-morrow.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who told you of him?\" I inquired. \"_Not_ Dr. Quackenboss, I hope;\\r\\nnor yet Mr. Algernon Coleyard?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles paused and reflected. \"No, neither of them,\" he answered,\\r\\nafter a short internal deliberation. \"It was that magazine editor\\r\\nchap we met at Wrengold\\'s.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_He\\'s_ all right,\" I said; \"or, at least, I think so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we wrote a polite invitation to Dr. Beddersley, who pursued\\r\\nthe method professionally, asking him to come and lunch with us\\r\\nat Mayfair at two next day.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Beddersley came--a dapper little man, with pent-house eyebrows,\\r\\nand keen, small eyes, whom I suspected at sight of being Colonel\\r\\nClay himself in another of his clever polymorphic embodiments. He\\r\\nwas clear and concise. His manner was scientific. He told us at once\\r\\nthat though the Bertillon method was of little use till the expert\\r\\nhad seen the criminal once, yet if we had consulted him earlier\\r\\nhe might probably have saved us some serious disasters. \"A man\\r\\nso ingenious as this,\" he said, \"would no doubt have studied\\r\\nBertillon\\'s principles himself, and would take every possible\\r\\nmeans to prevent recognition by them. Therefore, you might almost\\r\\ndisregard the nose, the chin, the moustache, the hair, all of which\\r\\nare capable of such easy alteration. But there remain some features\\r\\nwhich are more likely to persist--height, shape of head, neck,\\r\\nbuild, and fingers; the timbre of the voice, the colour of the iris.\\r\\nEven these, again, may be partially disguised or concealed; the way\\r\\nthe hair is dressed, the amount of padding, a high collar round the\\r\\nthroat, a dark line about the eyelashes, may do more to alter the\\r\\nappearance of a face than you could readily credit.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So we know,\" I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The voice, again,\" Dr. Beddersley continued. \"The voice itself may\\r\\nbe most fallacious. The man is no doubt a clever mimic. He could,\\r\\nperhaps, compress or enlarge his larynx. And I judge from what you\\r\\ntell me that he took characters each time which compelled him\\r\\nlargely to alter and modify his tone and accent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"As the Mexican Seer, he had of course a\\r\\nSpanish intonation. As the little curate, he was a cultivated\\r\\nNorth-countryman. As David Granton, he spoke gentlemanly Scotch.\\r\\nAs Von Lebenstein, naturally, he was a South-German, trying to\\r\\nexpress himself in French. As Professor Schleiermacher, he was a\\r\\nNorth-German speaking broken English. As Elihu Quackenboss, he\\r\\nhad a fine and pronounced Kentucky flavour. And as the poet, he\\r\\ndrawled after the fashion of the clubs, with lingering remnants\\r\\nof a Devonshire ancestry.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Quite so,\" Dr. Beddersley answered. \"That is just what I should\\r\\nexpect. Now, the question is, do you know him to be one man, or\\r\\nis he really a gang? Is he a name for a syndicate? Have you any\\r\\nphotographs of Colonel Clay himself in any of his disguises?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not one,\" Charles answered. \"He produced some himself, when he was\\r\\nMedhurst the detective. But he pocketed them at once; and we never\\r\\nrecovered them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Could you get any?\" the doctor asked. \"Did you note the name and\\r\\naddress of the photographer?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Unfortunately, no,\" Charles replied. \"But the police at Nice showed\\r\\nus two. Perhaps we might borrow them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Until we get them,\" Dr. Beddersley said, \"I don\\'t know that we can\\r\\ndo anything. But if you can once give me two distinct photographs of\\r\\nthe real man, no matter how much disguised, I could tell you whether\\r\\nthey were taken from one person; and, if so, I think I could point\\r\\nout certain details in common which might aid us to go upon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this was at lunch. Amelia\\'s niece, Dolly Lingfield, was there,\\r\\nas it happened; and I chanced to note a most guilty look stealing\\r\\nover her face all the while we were talking. Suspicious as I had\\r\\nlearned to become by this time, however, I did not suspect Dolly of\\r\\nbeing in league with Colonel Clay; but, I confess, I wondered what\\r\\nher blush could indicate. After lunch, to my surprise, Dolly called\\r\\nme away from the rest into the library. \"Uncle Seymour,\" she said\\r\\nto me--the dear child calls me Uncle Seymour, though of course I am\\r\\nnot in any way related to her--\"_I_ have some photographs of Colonel\\r\\nClay, if you want them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_You_?\" I cried, astonished. \"Why, Dolly, how did you get them?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a minute or two she showed some little hesitation in telling me.\\r\\nAt last she whispered, \"You won\\'t be angry if I confess?\" (Dolly is\\r\\njust nineteen, and remarkably pretty.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My child,\" I said, \"why _should_ I be angry? You may confide in me\\r\\nimplicitly.\" (With a blush like that, who on earth could be angry\\r\\nwith her?)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And you won\\'t tell Aunt Amelia or Aunt Isabel?\" she inquired\\r\\nsomewhat anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not for worlds,\" I answered. (As a matter of fact, Amelia and\\r\\nIsabel are the last people in the world to whom I should dream\\r\\nof confiding anything that Dolly might tell me.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, I was stopping at Seldon, you know, when Mr. David Granton\\r\\nwas there,\" Dolly went on; \"--or, rather, when that scamp pretended\\r\\nhe was David Granton; and--and--you won\\'t be angry with me, will\\r\\nyou?--one day I took a snap-shot with my kodak at him and Aunt\\r\\nAmelia!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, what harm was there in that?\" I asked, bewildered. The wildest\\r\\nstretch of fancy could hardly conceive that the Honourable David had\\r\\nbeen _flirting_ with Amelia.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly coloured still more deeply. \"Oh, you know Bertie Winslow?\" she\\r\\nsaid. \"Well, he\\'s interested in photography--and--and also in _me_.\\r\\nAnd he\\'s invented a process, which isn\\'t of the slightest practical\\r\\nuse, he says; but its peculiarity is, that it reveals textures. At\\r\\nleast, that\\'s what Bertie calls it. It makes things come out so. And\\r\\nhe gave me some plates of his own for my kodak--half-a-dozen or more,\\r\\nand--I took Aunt Amelia with them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I still fail to see,\" I murmured, looking at her comically.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, Uncle Seymour,\" Dolly cried. \"How blind you men are!\\r\\nIf Aunt Amelia knew she would never forgive me. Why, you _must_\\r\\nunderstand. The--the rouge, you know, and the pearl powder!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, it comes out, then, in the photograph?\" I inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Comes out! I should _think_ so! It\\'s like little black spots all\\r\\nover auntie\\'s face. _such_ a guy as she looks in it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And Colonel Clay is in them too?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes; I took them when he and auntie were talking together, without\\r\\neither of them noticing. And Bertie developed them. I\\'ve three of\\r\\nDavid Granton. Three beauties; _most_ successful.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Any other character?\" I asked, seeing business ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly hung back, still redder. \"Well, the rest are with Aunt\\r\\nIsabel,\" she answered, after a struggle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear child,\" I replied, hiding my feelings as a husband, \"I will\\r\\nbe brave. I will bear up even against that last misfortune!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly looked up at me pleadingly. \"It was here in London,\" she went\\r\\non; \"--when I was last with auntie. Medhurst was stopping in the\\r\\nhouse at the time; and I took him twice, t\\xc3\\xaate-\\xc3\\xa0-t\\xc3\\xaate with Aunt\\r\\nIsabel!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Isabel does not paint,\" I murmured, stoutly.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly hung back again. \"No, but--her hair!\" she suggested, in a\\r\\nfaint voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Its colour,\" I admitted, \"is in places assisted by a--well, you\\r\\nknow, a restorer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly broke into a mischievous sly smile. \"Yes, it is,\" she\\r\\ncontinued. \"And, oh, Uncle Sey, where the restorer has--er--restored\\r\\nit, you know, it comes out in the photograph with a sort of\\r\\nbrilliant iridescent metallic sheen on it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bring them down, my dear,\" I said, gently patting her head with my\\r\\nhand. In the interests of justice, I thought it best not to frighten\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nDolly brought them down. They seemed to me poor things, yet well\\r\\nworth trying. We found it possible, on further confabulation, by\\r\\nthe simple aid of a pair of scissors, so to cut each in two that\\r\\nall trace of Amelia and Isabel was obliterated. Even so, however,\\r\\nI judged it best to call Charles and Dr. Beddersley to a private\\r\\nconsultation in the library with Dolly, and not to submit the\\r\\nmutilated photographs to public inspection by their joint subjects.\\r\\nHere, in fact, we had five patchy portraits of the redoubtable\\r\\nColonel, taken at various angles, and in characteristic unstudied\\r\\nattitudes. A child had outwitted the cleverest sharper in Europe!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment Beddersley\\'s eye fell upon them, a curious look came over\\r\\nhis face. \"Why, these,\" he said, \"are taken on Herbert Winslow\\'s\\r\\nmethod, Miss Lingfield.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes,\" Dolly admitted timidly. \"They are. He\\'s--a friend of mine,\\r\\ndon\\'t you know; and--he gave me some plates that just fitted my\\r\\ncamera.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBeddersley gazed at them steadily. Then he turned to Charles.\\r\\n\"And this young lady,\" he said, \"has quite unintentionally and\\r\\nunconsciously succeeded in tracking Colonel Clay to earth at last.\\r\\nThey are genuine photographs of the man--as he is--_without_ the\\r\\ndisguises!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They look to me most blotchy,\" Charles murmured. \"Great black lines\\r\\ndown the nose, and such spots on the cheek, too!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Exactly,\" Beddersley put in. \"Those are _differences in texture_.\\r\\nThey show just how much of the man\\'s face is human flesh--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And how much wax,\" I ventured.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not wax,\" the expert answered, gazing close. \"This is some harder\\r\\nmixture. I should guess, a composition of gutta-percha and\\r\\nindia-rubber, which takes colour well, and hardens when applied,\\r\\nso as to lie quite evenly, and resist heat or melting. Look here;\\r\\nthat\\'s an artificial scar, filling up a real hollow; and _this_ is\\r\\nan added bit to the tip of the nose; and _those_ are shadows, due\\r\\nto inserted cheek-pieces, within the mouth, to make the man look\\r\\nfatter!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, of course,\" Charles cried. \"India-rubber it must be. That\\'s\\r\\nwhy in France they call him le Colonel Caoutchouc!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can you reconstruct the real face from them?\" I inquired anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Beddersley gazed hard at them. \"Give me an hour or two,\" he\\r\\nsaid--\"and a box of water-colours. I _think_ by that time--putting\\r\\ntwo and two together--I can eliminate the false and build up for you\\r\\na tolerably correct idea of what the actual man himself looks like.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe turned him into the library for a couple of hours, with the\\r\\nmaterials he needed; and by tea-time he had completed his first\\r\\nrough sketch of the elements common to the two faces. He brought\\r\\nit out to us in the drawing-room. I glanced at it first. It was\\r\\na curious countenance, slightly wanting in definiteness, and not\\r\\nunlike those \"composite photographs\" which Mr. Galton produces by\\r\\nexposing two negatives on the same sensitised paper for ten seconds\\r\\nor so consecutively. Yet it struck me at once as containing\\r\\nsomething of Colonel Clay in every one of his many representations.\\r\\nThe little curate, in real life, did not recall the Seer; nor\\r\\ndid Elihu Quackenboss suggest Count von Lebenstein or Professor\\r\\nSchleiermacher. Yet in this compound face, produced only from\\r\\nphotographs of David Granton and Medhurst, I could distinctly trace\\r\\na certain underlying likeness to every one of the forms which the\\r\\nimpostor had assumed for us. In other words, though he could make\\r\\nup so as to mask the likeness to his other characters, he could not\\r\\nmake up so as to mask the likeness to his own personality. He could\\r\\nnot wholly get rid of his native build and his genuine features.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides these striking suggestions of the Seer and the curate,\\r\\nhowever, I felt vaguely conscious of having seen and observed\\r\\n_the man himself_ whom the water-colour represented, at some time,\\r\\nsomewhere. It was not at Nice; it was not at Seldon; it was not at\\r\\nMeran; it was not in America. I believed I had been in a room with\\r\\nhim somewhere in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was looking over my shoulder. He gave a sudden little start.\\r\\n\"Why, I know that fellow!\" he cried. \"You recollect him, Sey; he\\'s\\r\\nFinglemore\\'s brother--the chap that didn\\'t go out to China!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I remembered at once where it was that I had seen him--at the\\r\\nbroker\\'s in the city, before we sailed for America.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What Christian name?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles reflected a moment. \"The same as the one in the note we got\\r\\nwith the dust-coat,\" he answered, at last. \"The man is Paul\\r\\nFinglemore!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You will arrest him?\" I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can I, on this evidence?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We might bring it home to him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles mused for a moment. \"We shall have nothing against him,\"\\r\\nhe said slowly, \"except in so far as we can swear to his identity.\\r\\nAnd that may be difficult.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust at that moment the footman brought in tea. Charles wondered\\r\\napparently whether the man, who had been with us at Seldon when\\r\\nColonel Clay was David Granton, would recollect the face or\\r\\nrecognise having seen it. \"Look here, Dudley,\" he said, holding\\r\\nup the water-colour, \"do you know that person?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDudley gazed at it a moment. \"Certainly, sir,\" he answered briskly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is it?\" Amelia asked. We expected him to answer, \"Count von\\r\\nLebenstein,\" or \"Mr. Granton,\" or \"Medhurst.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of that, he replied, to our utter surprise, \"That\\'s\\r\\nC\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s young man, my lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"C\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s young man?\" Amelia repeated, taken aback. \"Oh, Dudley,\\r\\nsurely, you _must_ be mistaken!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, my lady,\" Dudley replied, in a tone of conviction. \"He comes\\r\\nto see her quite reg\\'lar; he have come to see her, off and on,\\r\\nfrom time to time, ever since I\\'ve been in Sir Charles\\'s service.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When will he be coming again?\" Charles asked, breathless.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'s downstairs now, sir,\" Dudley answered, unaware of the\\r\\nbombshell he was flinging into the midst of a respectable family.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles rose excitedly, and put his back against the door. \"Secure\\r\\nthat man,\" he said to me sharply, pointing with his finger.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"_What_ man?\" I asked, amazed. \"Colonel Clay? The young man who\\'s\\r\\ndownstairs now with C\\xc3\\xa9sarine?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" Charles answered, with decision; \"Dudley!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI laid my hand on the footman\\'s shoulder, not understanding what\\r\\nCharles meant. Dudley, terrified, drew back, and would have rushed\\r\\nfrom the room; but Charles, with his back against the door,\\r\\nprevented him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I--I\\'ve done nothing to be arrested, Sir Charles,\" Dudley cried,\\r\\nin abject terror, looking appealingly at Amelia. \"It--it wasn\\'t me\\r\\nas cheated you.\" And he certainly didn\\'t look it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I daresay not,\" Charles answered. \"But you don\\'t leave this room\\r\\ntill Colonel Clay is in custody. No, Amelia, no; it\\'s no use your\\r\\nspeaking to me. What he says is true. I see it all now. This villain\\r\\nand C\\xc3\\xa9sarine have long been accomplices! The man\\'s downstairs with\\r\\nher now. If we let Dudley quit the room he\\'ll go down and tell them;\\r\\nand before we know where we are, that slippery eel will have\\r\\nwriggled through our fingers, as he always wriggles. He _is_ Paul\\r\\nFinglemore; he _is_ C\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s young man; and unless we arrest him\\r\\nnow, without one minute\\'s delay, he\\'ll be off to Madrid or St.\\r\\nPetersburg by this evening!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are right,\" I answered. \"It is now or never!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dudley,\" Charles said, in his most authoritative voice, \"stop here\\r\\ntill we tell you you may leave the room. Amelia and Dolly, don\\'t let\\r\\nthat man stir from where he\\'s standing. If he does, restrain him.\\r\\nSeymour and Dr. Beddersley, come down with me to the servants\\' hall.\\r\\nI suppose that\\'s where I shall find this person, Dudley?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"N--no, sir,\" Dudley stammered out, half beside himself with fright.\\r\\n\"He\\'s in the housekeeper\\'s room, sir!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went down to the lower regions in a solid phalanx of three. On\\r\\nthe way we met Simpson, Sir Charles\\'s valet, and also the butler,\\r\\nwhom we pressed into the service. At the door of the housekeeper\\'s\\r\\nroom we paused, strategically. Voices came to us from within; one\\r\\nwas C\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s, the other had a ring that reminded me at once of\\r\\nMedhurst and the Seer, of Elihu Quackenboss and Algernon Coleyard.\\r\\nThey were talking together in French; and now and then we caught\\r\\nthe sound of stifled laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe opened the door. \"Est-il dr\\xc3\\xb4le, donc, ce vieux?\" the man\\'s\\r\\nvoice was saying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"C\\'est \\xc3\\xa0 mourir de rire,\" C\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s voice responded.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe burst in upon them, red-handed.\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s young man rose, with his hat in his hand, in a respectful\\r\\nattitude. It reminded me at once of Medhurst, as he stood talking\\r\\nhis first day at Marvillier\\'s to Charles; and also of the little\\r\\ncurate, in his humblest moments as the disinterested pastor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a sign to me to do likewise, Charles laid his hand firmly on\\r\\nthe young man\\'s shoulder. I looked in the fellow\\'s face: there could\\r\\nbe no denying it; C\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s young man was Paul Finglemore, our\\r\\nbroker\\'s brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Paul Finglemore,\" Charles said severely, \"otherwise Cuthbert Clay,\\r\\nI arrest you on several charges of theft and conspiracy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man glanced around him. He was surprised and perturbed;\\r\\nbut, even so, his inexhaustible coolness never once deserted him.\\r\\n\"What, five to one?\" he said, counting us over. \"Has law and order\\r\\ncome down to this? Five respectable rascals to arrest one poor\\r\\nbeggar of a chevalier d\\'industrie! Why, it\\'s worse than New York.\\r\\n_There_, it was only you and me, you know, old Ten per Cent!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hold his hands, Simpson!\" Charles cried, trembling lest his enemy\\r\\nshould escape him.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Finglemore drew back even while we held his shoulders. \"No,\\r\\nnot _you_, sir,\" he said to the man, haughtily. \"Don\\'t dare to lay\\r\\nyour hands upon me! Send for a constable if you wish, Sir Charles\\r\\nVandrift; but I decline to be taken into custody by a valet!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go for a policeman,\" Dr. Beddersley said to Simpson, standing\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner eyed him up and down. \"Oh, Dr. Beddersley!\" he said,\\r\\nrelieved. It was evident he knew him. \"If _you\\'ve_ tracked me\\r\\nstrictly in accordance with Bertillon\\'s methods, I don\\'t mind so\\r\\nmuch. I will not yield to fools; I yield to science. I didn\\'t think\\r\\nthis diamond king had sense enough to apply to you. He\\'s the most\\r\\ngullible old ass I ever met in my life. But if it\\'s _you_ who have\\r\\ntracked me down, I can only submit to it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles held to him with a fierce grip. \"Mind he doesn\\'t break away,\\r\\nSey,\" he cried. \"He\\'s playing his old game! Distrust the man\\'s\\r\\npatter!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Take care,\" the prisoner put in. \"Remember Dr. Polperro! On what\\r\\ncharge do you arrest me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was bubbling with indignation. \"You cheated me at Nice,\"\\r\\nhe said; \"at Meran; at New York; at Paris!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul Finglemore shook his head. \"Won\\'t do,\" he answered, calmly. \"Be\\r\\nsure of your ground. Outside the jurisdiction! You can only do that\\r\\non an extradition warrant.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, then, at Seldon, in London, in this house, and elsewhere,\"\\r\\nCharles cried out excitedly. \"Hold hard to him, Sey; by law or\\r\\nwithout it, blessed if he isn\\'t going even now to wriggle away\\r\\nfrom us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Simpson returned with a convenient policeman, whom he\\r\\nhad happened to find loitering about near the area steps, and whom I\\r\\nhalf suspected from his furtive smile of being a particular\\r\\nacquaintance of the household.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles gave the man in charge formally. Paul Finglemore insisted\\r\\nthat he should specify the nature of the particular accusation.\\r\\nTo my great chagrin, Charles selected from his rogueries, as best\\r\\nwithin the jurisdiction of the English courts, the matter of the\\r\\npayment for the Castle of Lebenstein--made in London, and through\\r\\na London banker. \"I have a warrant on that ground,\" he said. I\\r\\ntrembled as he spoke. I felt at once that the episode of the\\r\\ncommission, the exposure of which I dreaded so much, must now\\r\\nbecome public.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policeman took the man in charge. Charles still held to him,\\r\\ngrimly. As they were leaving the room the prisoner turned to\\r\\nC\\xc3\\xa9sarine, and muttered something rapidly under his breath, in\\r\\nGerman. \"Of which tongue,\" he said, turning to us blandly, \"in spite\\r\\nof my kind present of a dictionary and grammar, you still doubtless\\r\\nremain in your pristine ignorance!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nC\\xc3\\xa9sarine flung herself upon him with wild devotion. \"Oh, Paul,\\r\\ndarling,\" she cried, in English, \"I will not, I will not! I\\r\\nwill never save myself at _your_ expense. If they send you to\\r\\nprison--Paul, Paul, I will go with you!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI remembered as she spoke what Mr. Algernon Coleyard had said to us\\r\\nat the Senator\\'s. \"Even the worst of rogues have always some good\\r\\nin them. I notice they often succeed to the end in retaining the\\r\\naffection and fidelity of women.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the man, his hands still free, unwound her clasping arms with\\r\\ngentle fingers. \"My child,\" he answered, in a soft tone, \"I am sorry\\r\\nto say the law of England will not permit you to go with me. If it\\r\\ndid\" (his voice was as the voice of the poet we had met), \"\\'stone\\r\\nwalls would not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage.\\'\" And bending\\r\\nforward, he kissed her forehead tenderly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe led him out to the door. The policeman, in obedience to Charles\\'s\\r\\norders, held him tight with his hand, but steadily refused, as the\\r\\nprisoner was not violent, to handcuff him. We hailed a passing\\r\\nhansom. \"To Bow Street!\" Charles cried, unceremoniously pushing in\\r\\npoliceman and prisoner. The driver nodded. We called a four-wheeler\\r\\nourselves, in which my brother-in-law, Dr. Beddersley and myself\\r\\ntook our seats. \"Follow the hansom!\" Charles cried out. \"Don\\'t let\\r\\nhim out of your sight. After him, close, to Bow Street!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked back, and saw C\\xc3\\xa9sarine, half fainting, on the front door\\r\\nsteps, while Dolly, bathed in tears, stood supporting the\\r\\nlady\\'s-maid, and trying to comfort her. It was clear she had not\\r\\nanticipated this end to the adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Goodness gracious!\" Charles screamed out, in a fresh fever of\\r\\nalarm, as we turned the first corner; \"where\\'s that hansom gone to?\\r\\nHow do I know the fellow was a policeman at all? We should have\\r\\ntaken the man in here. We ought never to have let him get out of\\r\\nour sight. For all we can tell to the contrary, the constable\\r\\nhimself--may only be one of Colonel Clay\\'s confederates!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we drove in trepidation all the way to Bow Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EPISODE OF THE OLD BAILEY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we reached Bow Street, we were relieved to find that our\\r\\nprisoner, after all, had _not_ evaded us. It was a false alarm.\\r\\nHe was there with the policeman, and he kindly allowed us to\\r\\nmake the first formal charge against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, on Charles\\'s sworn declaration and my own, the man was\\r\\nat once remanded, bail being refused, owing both to the serious\\r\\nnature of the charge and the slippery character of the prisoner\\'s\\r\\nantecedents. We went back to Mayfair--Charles, well satisfied that\\r\\nthe man he dreaded was under lock and key; myself, not too well\\r\\npleased to think that the man I dreaded was no longer at large, and\\r\\nthat the trifling little episode of the ten per cent commission\\r\\nstood so near discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day the police came round in force, and had a long consultation\\r\\nwith Charles and myself. They strongly urged that two other persons\\r\\nat least should be included in the charge--C\\xc3\\xa9sarine and the little\\r\\nwoman whom we had variously known as Madame Picardet, White Heather,\\r\\nMrs. David Granton, and Mrs. Elihu Quackenboss. If these accomplices\\r\\nwere arrested, they said, we could include conspiracy as one count\\r\\nin the indictment, which gave us an extra chance of conviction. Now\\r\\nthey had got Colonel Clay, in fact, they naturally desired to keep\\r\\nhim, and also to indict with him as many as possible of his pals\\r\\nand confederates.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, however, a difficulty arose. Charles called me aside with a\\r\\ngrave face into the library. \"Seymour,\" he said, fixing me, \"this\\r\\nis a serious business. I will not lightly swear away any woman\\'s\\r\\ncharacter. Colonel Clay himself--or, rather, Paul Finglemore--is an\\r\\nabandoned rogue, whom I do not desire to screen in any degree. But\\r\\npoor little Madame Picardet--she may be his lawful wife, and she\\r\\nmay have acted implicitly under his orders. Besides, I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhether I could swear to her identity. Here\\'s the photograph the\\r\\npolice bring of the woman they believe to be Colonel Clay\\'s chief\\r\\nfemale accomplice. Now, I ask you, does it in the least degree\\r\\nresemble that clever and amusing and charming little creature,\\r\\nwho has so often deceived us?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of Charles\\'s gibes, I flatter myself I do really understand\\r\\nthe whole duty of a secretary. It was clear from his voice he did\\r\\nnot _wish_ me to recognise her; which, as it happened, I did not.\\r\\n\"Certainly, it doesn\\'t resemble her, Charles,\" I answered, with\\r\\nconviction in my voice. \"I should never have known her.\" But I did\\r\\nnot add that I should no more have known Colonel Clay himself in\\r\\nhis character of Paul Finglemore, or of C\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s young man, as\\r\\n_that_ remark lay clearly outside my secretarial functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, it flitted across my mind at the time that the Seer had made\\r\\nsome casual remarks at Nice about a letter in Charles\\'s pocket,\\r\\npresumably from Madame Picardet; and I reflected further that Madame\\r\\nPicardet in turn might possibly hold certain answers of Charles\\'s,\\r\\ncouched in such terms as he might reasonably desire to conceal from\\r\\nAmelia. Indeed, I must allow that under whatever disguise White\\r\\nHeather appeared to us, Charles was always that disguise\\'s devoted\\r\\nslave from the first moment he met it. It occurred to me, therefore,\\r\\nthat the clever little woman--call her what you will--might be the\\r\\nholder of more than one indiscreet communication.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Under these circumstances,\" Charles went on, in his austerest\\r\\nvoice, \"I cannot consent to be a party to the arrest of White\\r\\nHeather. I--I decline to identify her. In point of fact\"--he grew\\r\\nmore emphatic as he went on--\"I don\\'t think there is an atom of\\r\\nevidence of any sort against her. Not,\" he continued, after a\\r\\npause, \"that I wish in any degree to screen the guilty. C\\xc3\\xa9sarine,\\r\\nnow--C\\xc3\\xa9sarine we have liked and trusted. She has betrayed our trust.\\r\\nShe has sold us to this fellow. I have no doubt at all that she\\r\\ngave him the diamonds from Amelia\\'s rivi\\xc3\\xa8re; that she took us by\\r\\narrangement to meet him at Schloss Lebenstein; that she opened and\\r\\nsent to him my letter to Lord Craig-Ellachie. Therefore, I say, we\\r\\n_ought_ to arrest C\\xc3\\xa9sarine. But not White Heather--not Jessie; not\\r\\nthat pretty Mrs. Quackenboss. Let the guilty suffer; why strike at\\r\\nthe innocent--or, at worst, the misguided?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Charles,\" I exclaimed, with warmth, \"your sentiments do you honour.\\r\\nYou are a man of feeling. And White Heather, I allow, is pretty\\r\\nenough and clever enough to be forgiven anything. You may rely upon\\r\\nmy discretion. I will swear through thick and thin that I do not\\r\\nrecognise this woman as Madame Picardet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles clasped my hand in silence. \"Seymour,\" he said, after\\r\\na pause, with marked emotion, \"I felt sure I could rely upon\\r\\nyour--er--honour and integrity. I have been rough upon you\\r\\nsometimes. But I ask your forgiveness. I see you understand the\\r\\nwhole duties of your position.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe went out again, better friends than we had been for months.\\r\\nI hoped, indeed, this pleasant little incident might help to\\r\\nneutralise the possible ill-effects of the ten per cent disclosure,\\r\\nshould Finglemore take it into his head to betray me to my employer.\\r\\nAs we emerged into the drawing-room, Amelia beckoned me aside\\r\\ntowards her boudoir for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seymour,\" she said to me, in a distinctly frightened tone, \"I have\\r\\ntreated you harshly at times, I know, and I am very sorry for it.\\r\\nBut I want you to help me in a most painful difficulty. The police\\r\\nare quite right as to the charge of conspiracy; that designing\\r\\nlittle minx, White Heather, or Mrs. David Granton, or whatever else\\r\\nwe\\'re to call her, ought certainly to be prosecuted--and sent to\\r\\nprison, too--and have her absurd head of hair cut short and combed\\r\\nstraight for her. But--and you will help me here, I\\'m sure, dear\\r\\nSeymour--I _cannot_ allow them to arrest my C\\xc3\\xa9sarine. I don\\'t pretend\\r\\nto say C\\xc3\\xa9sarine isn\\'t guilty; the girl has behaved most ungratefully\\r\\nto me. She has robbed me right and left, and deceived me without\\r\\ncompunction. Still--I put it to you as a married man--_can_ any woman\\r\\nafford to go into the witness-box, to be cross-examined and teased\\r\\nby her own maid, or by a brute of a barrister on her maid\\'s\\r\\ninformation? I assure you, Seymour, the thing\\'s not to be dreamt of.\\r\\nThere are details of a lady\\'s life--known only to her maid--which\\r\\n_cannot_ be made public. Explain as much of this as you think well to\\r\\nCharles, and _make_ him understand that _if_ he insists upon arresting\\r\\nC\\xc3\\xa9sarine, I shall go into the box--and swear my head off to prevent\\r\\nany one of the gang from being convicted. I have told C\\xc3\\xa9sarine as\\r\\nmuch; I have promised to help her: I have explained that I am her\\r\\nfriend, and that if _she\\'ll_ stand by _me_, _I\\'ll_ stand by _her_,\\r\\nand by this hateful young man of hers.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw in a moment how things went. Neither Charles nor Amelia could\\r\\nface cross-examination on the subject of one of Colonel Clay\\'s\\r\\naccomplices. No doubt, in Amelia\\'s case, it was merely a question\\r\\nof rouge and hair-dye; but what woman would not sooner confess to\\r\\na forgery or a murder than to those toilet secrets?\\r\\n\\r\\nI returned to Charles, therefore, and spent half an hour in\\r\\ncomposing, as well as I might, these little domestic difficulties.\\r\\nIn the end, it was arranged that if Charles did his best to protect\\r\\nC\\xc3\\xa9sarine from arrest, Amelia would consent to do her best in return\\r\\non behalf of Madame Picardet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had next the police to tackle--a more difficult business. Still,\\r\\neven _they_ were reasonable. They had caught Colonel Clay, they\\r\\nbelieved, but their chance of convicting him depended entirely upon\\r\\nCharles\\'s identification, with mine to back it. The more they urged\\r\\nthe necessity of arresting the female confederates, however, the\\r\\nmore stoutly did Charles declare that for his part he could by no\\r\\nmeans make sure of Colonel Clay himself, while he utterly declined\\r\\nto give evidence of any sort against either of the women. It was a\\r\\ndifficult case, he said, and he felt far from confident even about\\r\\nthe man. If _his_ decision faltered, and he failed to identify, the\\r\\ncase was closed; no jury could convict with nothing to convict upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the police gave way. No other course was open to them. They\\r\\nhad made an important capture; but they saw that everything depended\\r\\nupon securing their witnesses, and the witnesses, if interfered\\r\\nwith, were likely to swear to absolutely nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, as it turned out, before the preliminary investigation at\\r\\nBow Street was completed (with the usual remands), Charles had been\\r\\nthrown into such a state of agitation that he wished he had never\\r\\ncaught the Colonel at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I wonder, Sey,\" he said to me, \"why I didn\\'t offer the rascal two\\r\\nthousand a year to go right off to Australia, and be rid of him for\\r\\never! It would have been cheaper for my reputation than keeping him\\r\\nabout in courts of law in England. The worst of it is, when once the\\r\\nbest of men gets into a witness-box, there\\'s no saying with what\\r\\nshreds and tatters of a character he may at last come out of it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In _your_ case, Charles,\" I answered, dutifully, \"there can be\\r\\nno such doubt; except, perhaps, as regards the Craig-Ellachie\\r\\nConsolidated.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came the endless bother of \"getting up the case\" with the\\r\\npolice and the lawyers. Charles would have retired from it\\r\\naltogether by that time, but, most unfortunately, he was bound\\r\\nover to prosecute. \"You couldn\\'t take a lump sum to let me off?\"\\r\\nhe said, jokingly, to the inspector. But I knew in my heart it was\\r\\none of the \"true words spoken in jest\" that the proverb tells of.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course we could see now the whole building-up of the great\\r\\nintrigue. It had been worked out as carefully as the Tichborne\\r\\nswindle. Young Finglemore, as the brother of Charles\\'s broker,\\r\\nknew from the outset all about his affairs; and, after a gentle\\r\\ncourse of preliminary roguery, he laid his plans deep for a campaign\\r\\nagainst my brother-in-law. Everything had been deliberately\\r\\ndesigned beforehand. A place had been found for C\\xc3\\xa9sarine as Amelia\\'s\\r\\nmaid--needless to say, by means of forged testimonials. Through her\\r\\naid the swindler had succeeded in learning still more of the family\\r\\nways and habits, and had acquired a knowledge of certain facts which\\r\\nhe proceeded forthwith to use against us. His first attack, as the\\r\\nSeer, had been cleverly designed so as to give us the idea that we\\r\\nwere a mere casual prey; and it did not escape Charles\\'s notice now\\r\\nthat the detail of getting Madame Picardet to inquire at the Cr\\xc3\\xa9dit\\r\\nMarseillais about his bank had been solemnly gone through on purpose\\r\\nto blind us to the obvious truth that Colonel Clay was already in\\r\\nfull possession of all such facts about us. It was by C\\xc3\\xa9sarine\\'s\\r\\naid, again, that he became possessed of Amelia\\'s diamonds, that\\r\\nhe received the letter addressed to Lord Craig-Ellachie, and\\r\\nthat he managed to dupe us over the Schloss Lebenstein business.\\r\\nNevertheless, all these things Charles determined to conceal in\\r\\ncourt; he did not give the police a single fact that would turn\\r\\nagainst either C\\xc3\\xa9sarine or Madame Picardet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for C\\xc3\\xa9sarine, of course, she left the house immediately after the\\r\\narrest of the Colonel, and we heard of her no more till the day of\\r\\nthe trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen that great day came, I never saw a more striking sight than the\\r\\nOld Bailey presented. It was crammed to overflowing. Charles arrived\\r\\nearly, accompanied by his solicitor. He was so white and troubled\\r\\nthat he looked much more like prisoner than prosecutor. Outside the\\r\\ncourt a pretty little woman stood, pale and anxious. A respectful\\r\\ncrowd stared at her silently. \"Who is that?\" Charles asked. Though\\r\\nwe could both of us guess, rather than see, it was White Heather.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s the prisoner\\'s wife,\" the inspector on duty replied. \"She\\'s\\r\\nwaiting to see him enter. I\\'m sorry for her, poor thing. She\\'s a\\r\\nperfect lady.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So she seems,\" Charles answered, scarcely daring to face her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment she turned. Her eyes fell upon his. Charles paused\\r\\nfor a second and looked faltering. There was in those eyes just the\\r\\nfaintest gleam of pleading recognition, but not a trace of the old\\r\\nsaucy, defiant vivacity. Charles framed his lips to words, but\\r\\nwithout uttering a sound. Unless I greatly mistake, the words he\\r\\nframed on his lips were these: \"I will do my best for him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe pushed our way in, assisted by the police. Inside the court we\\r\\nsaw a lady seated, in a quiet black dress, with a becoming bonnet.\\r\\nA moment passed before I knew--it was C\\xc3\\xa9sarine. \"Who is--that\\r\\nperson?\" Charles asked once more of the nearest inspector, desiring\\r\\nto see in what way he would describe her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd once more the answer came, \"That\\'s the prisoner\\'s wife, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles started back, surprised. \"But--I was told--a lady outside\\r\\nwas Mrs. Paul Finglemore,\" he broke in, much puzzled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very likely,\" the inspector replied, unmoved. \"We have plenty that\\r\\nway. _When_ a gentleman has as many aliases as Colonel Clay, you can\\r\\nhardly expect him to be over particular about having only _one_ wife\\r\\nbetween them, can you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, I see,\" Charles muttered, in a shocked voice. \"Bigamy!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inspector looked stony. \"Well, not exactly that,\" he replied,\\r\\n\"occasional marriage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Justice Rhadamanth tried the case. \"I\\'m sorry it\\'s him, Sey,\"\\r\\nmy brother-in-law whispered in my ear. (He said _him_, not _he_,\\r\\nbecause, whatever else Charles is, he is _not_ a pedant; the English\\r\\nlanguage as it is spoken by most educated men is quite good enough\\r\\nfor his purpose.) \"I only wish it had been Sir Edward Easy. Easy\\'s a\\r\\nman of the world, and a man of society; he would feel for a person\\r\\nin _my_ position. He wouldn\\'t allow these beasts of lawyers to\\r\\nbadger and pester me. He would back his order. But Rhadamanth is one\\r\\nof your modern sort of judges, who make a merit of being what they\\r\\ncall \\'conscientious,\\' and won\\'t hush up anything. I admit I\\'m afraid\\r\\nof him. I shall be glad when it\\'s over.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, _you\\'ll_ pull through all right,\" I said in my capacity of\\r\\nsecretary. But I didn\\'t think it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe judge took his seat. The prisoner was brought in. Every eye\\r\\nseemed bent upon him. He was neatly and plainly dressed, and,\\r\\nrogue though he was, I must honestly confess he looked at least a\\r\\ngentleman. His manner was defiant, not abject like Charles\\'s. He\\r\\nknew he was at bay, and he turned like a man to face his accusers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had two or three counts on the charge, and, after some formal\\r\\nbusiness, Sir Charles Vandrift was put into the box to bear witness\\r\\nagainst Finglemore.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrisoner was unrepresented. Counsel had been offered him, but he\\r\\nrefused their aid. The judge even advised him to accept their help;\\r\\nbut Colonel Clay, as we all called him mentally still, declined to\\r\\navail himself of the judge\\'s suggestion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am a barrister myself, my lord,\" he said--\"called some nine years\\r\\nago. I can conduct my own defence, I venture to think, better than\\r\\nany of these my learned brethren.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles went through his examination-in-chief quite swimmingly.\\r\\nHe answered with promptitude. He identified the prisoner without\\r\\nthe slightest hesitation as the man who had swindled him under\\r\\nthe various disguises of the Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon,\\r\\nthe Honourable David Granton, Count von Lebenstein, Professor\\r\\nSchleiermacher, Dr. Quackenboss, and others. He had not the\\r\\nslightest doubt of the man\\'s identity. He could swear to him\\r\\nanywhere. I thought, for my own part, he was a trifle too cocksure.\\r\\nA certain amount of hesitation would have been better policy. As\\r\\nto the various swindles, he detailed them in full, his evidence to\\r\\nbe supplemented by that of bank officials and other subordinates.\\r\\nIn short, he left Finglemore not a leg to stand upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it came to the cross-examination, however, matters began\\r\\nto assume quite a different complexion. The prisoner set out by\\r\\nquestioning Sir Charles\\'s identifications. Was he sure of his man?\\r\\nHe handed Charles a photograph. \"Is that the person who represented\\r\\nhimself as the Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon?\" he asked\\r\\npersuasively.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles admitted it without a moment\\'s delay.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust at that moment, a little parson, whom I had not noticed till\\r\\nthen, rose up, unobtrusively, near the middle of the court, where\\r\\nhe was seated beside C\\xc3\\xa9sarine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look at that gentleman!\" the prisoner said, waving one hand, and\\r\\npouncing upon the prosecutor.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles turned and looked at the person indicated. His face grew\\r\\nstill whiter. It was--to all outer appearance--the Reverend Richard\\r\\nBrabazon in propri\\xc3\\xa2 person\\xc3\\xa2.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course I saw the trick. This was the real parson upon whose outer\\r\\nman Colonel Clay had modelled his little curate. But the jury was\\r\\nshaken. And so was Charles for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let the jurors see the photograph,\" the judge said, authoritatively.\\r\\nIt was passed round the jury-box, and the judge also examined it.\\r\\nWe could see at once, by their faces and attitudes, they all\\r\\nrecognised it as the portrait of the clergyman before them--not\\r\\nof the prisoner in the dock, who stood there smiling blandly at\\r\\nCharles\\'s discomfiture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clergyman sat down. At the same moment the prisoner produced a\\r\\nsecond photograph.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now, can you tell me who _that_ is?\" he asked Charles, in the regular\\r\\nbrow-beating Old Bailey voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith somewhat more hesitation, Charles answered, after a pause:\\r\\n\"That is yourself as you appeared in London when you came in the\\r\\ndisguise of the Graf von Lebenstein.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a crucial point, for the Lebenstein fraud was the one count\\r\\non which our lawyers relied to prove their case most fully, within\\r\\nthe jurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven while Charles spoke, a gentleman whom I had noticed before,\\r\\nsitting beside White Heather, with a handkerchief to his face,\\r\\nrose as abruptly as the parson. Colonel Clay indicated him with\\r\\na graceful movement of his hand. \"And _this_ gentleman?\" he asked\\r\\ncalmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was fairly staggered. It was the obvious original of the\\r\\nfalse Von Lebenstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photograph went round the box once more. The jury smiled\\r\\nincredulously. Charles had given himself away. His overweening\\r\\nconfidence and certainty had ruined him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Colonel Clay, leaning forward, and looking quite engaging,\\r\\nbegan a new line of cross-examination. \"We have seen, Sir Charles,\"\\r\\nhe said, \"that we cannot implicitly trust your identifications. Now\\r\\nlet us see how far we can trust your other evidence. First, then,\\r\\nabout those diamonds. You tried to buy them, did you not, from a\\r\\nperson who represented himself as the Reverend Richard Brabazon,\\r\\nbecause you believed he thought they were paste; and if you could,\\r\\nyou would have given him 10 pounds or so for them. _Do_ you think\\r\\nthat was honest?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I object to this line of cross-examination,\" our leading counsel\\r\\ninterposed. \"It does not bear on the prosecutor\\'s evidence. It is\\r\\npurely recriminatory.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Clay was all bland deference. \"I wish, my lord,\" he said,\\r\\nturning round, \"to show that the prosecutor is a person unworthy of\\r\\ncredence in any way. I desire to proceed upon the well-known legal\\r\\nmaxim of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus. I believe I am permitted\\r\\nto shake the witness\\'s credit?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The prisoner is entirely within his rights,\" Rhadamanth answered,\\r\\nlooking severely at Charles. \"And I was wrong in suggesting that\\r\\nhe needed the advice or assistance of counsel.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles wriggled visibly. Colonel Clay perked up. Bit by bit, with\\r\\ndexterous questions, Charles was made to acknowledge that he wanted\\r\\nto buy diamonds at the price of paste, knowing them to be real; and,\\r\\na millionaire himself, would gladly have diddled a poor curate out\\r\\nof a couple of thousand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was entitled to take advantage of my special knowledge,\" Charles\\r\\nmurmured feebly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, certainly,\" the prisoner answered. \"But, while professing\\r\\nfriendship and affection for a clergyman and his wife, in straitened\\r\\ncircumstances, you were prepared, it seems, to take three thousand\\r\\npounds\\' worth of goods off their hands for ten pounds, if you could\\r\\nhave got them at that price. Is not that so?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles was compelled to admit it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner went onto the David Granton incident. \"When you offered\\r\\nto amalgamate with Lord Craig-Ellachie,\" he asked, \"had you or\\r\\nhad you not heard that a gold-bearing reef ran straight from your\\r\\nconcession into Lord Craig-Ellachie\\'s, and that his portion of the\\r\\nreef was by far the larger and more important?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles wriggled again, and our counsel interposed; but Rhadamanth\\r\\nwas adamant. Charles had to allow it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, too, with the incident of the Slump in Golcondas.\\r\\nUnwillingly, shamefacedly, by torturing steps, Charles was compelled\\r\\nto confess that he had sold out Golcondas--he, the Chairman of the\\r\\ncompany, after repeated declarations to shareholders and others\\r\\nthat he would do no such thing--because he thought Professor\\r\\nSchleiermacher had made diamonds worthless. He had endeavoured to\\r\\nsave himself by ruining his company. Charles tried to brazen it out\\r\\nwith remarks to the effect that business was business. \"And fraud is\\r\\nfraud,\" Rhadamanth added, in his pungent way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A man must protect himself,\" Charles burst out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"At the expense of those who have put their trust in his honour and\\r\\nintegrity,\" the judge commented coldly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter four mortal hours of it, all to the same effect, my respected\\r\\nbrother-in-law left the witness-box at last, wiping his brow and\\r\\nbiting his lip, with the very air of a culprit. His character had\\r\\nreceived a most serious blow. While he stood in the witness-box all\\r\\nthe world had felt it was _he_ who was the accused and Colonel Clay\\r\\nwho was the prosecutor. He was convicted on his own evidence of\\r\\nhaving tried to induce the supposed David Granton to sell his\\r\\nfather\\'s interests into an enemy\\'s hands, and of every other shady\\r\\ntrick into which his well-known business acuteness had unfortunately\\r\\nhurried him during the course of his adventures. I had but one\\r\\nconsolation in my brother-in-law\\'s misfortunes--and that was the\\r\\nthought that a due sense of his own shortcomings might possibly make\\r\\nhim more lenient in the end to the trivial misdemeanours of a poor\\r\\nbeggar of a secretary!\\r\\n\\r\\n_I_ was the next in the box. I do not desire to enlarge upon my own\\r\\nachievements. I will draw a decent veil, indeed, over the painful\\r\\nscene that ensued when I finished my evidence. I can only say I was\\r\\nmore cautious than Charles in my recognition of the photographs;\\r\\nbut I found myself particularly worried and harried over other\\r\\nparts of my cross-examination. Especially was I shaken about that\\r\\nmisguided step I took in the matter of the cheque for the Lebenstein\\r\\ncommission--a cheque which Colonel Clay handed to me with the utmost\\r\\npoliteness, requesting to know whether or not it bore my signature.\\r\\nI caught Charles\\'s eye at the end of the episode, and I venture to\\r\\nsay the expression it wore was one of relief that I too had tripped\\r\\nover a trifling question of ten per cent on the purchase money of\\r\\nthe castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAltogether, I must admit, if it had not been for the police\\r\\nevidence, we would have failed to make a case against our man\\r\\nat all. But the police, I confess, had got up their part of the\\r\\nprosecution admirably. Now that they knew Colonel Clay to be\\r\\nreally Paul Finglemore, they showed with great cleverness how Paul\\r\\nFinglemore\\'s disappearances and reappearances in London exactly\\r\\ntallied with Colonel Clay\\'s appearances and disappearances\\r\\nelsewhere, under the guise of the little curate, the Seer,\\r\\nDavid Granton, and the rest of them. Furthermore, they showed\\r\\nexperimentally how the prisoner at the bar might have got himself\\r\\nup in the various characters; and, by means of a wax bust, modelled\\r\\nby Dr. Beddersley from observations at Bow Street, and aided by\\r\\nadditions in the gutta-percha composition after Dolly Lingfield\\'s\\r\\nphotographs, they succeeded in proving that the face as it stood\\r\\ncould be readily transformed into the faces of Medhurst and David\\r\\nGranton. Altogether, their cleverness and trained acumen made up\\r\\non the whole for Charles\\'s over-certainty, and they succeeded in\\r\\nputting before the jury a strong case of their own against Paul\\r\\nFinglemore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trial occupied three days. After the first of the three, my\\r\\nrespected brother-in-law preferred, as he said, not to prejudice the\\r\\ncase against the prisoner by appearing in court again. He did not\\r\\neven allude to the little matter of the ten per cent commission\\r\\nfurther than to say at dinner that evening that all men were bound\\r\\nto protect their own interests--as secretaries or as principals.\\r\\nThis I took for forgiveness; and I continued diligently to attend\\r\\nthe trial, and watch the case in my employer\\'s interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defence was ingenious, even if somewhat halting. It consisted\\r\\nsimply of an attempt to prove throughout that Charles and I had made\\r\\nour prisoner the victim of a mistaken identity. Finglemore put into\\r\\nthe box the ingenuous original of the little curate--the Reverend\\r\\nSeptimus Porkington, as it turned out, a friend of his family; and\\r\\nhe showed that it was the Reverend Septimus himself who had sat to\\r\\na photographer in Baker Street for the portrait which Charles too\\r\\nhastily identified as that of Colonel Clay in his personification of\\r\\nMr. Richard Brabazon. He further elicited the fact that the portrait\\r\\nof the Count von Lebenstein was really taken from Dr. Julius Keppel,\\r\\na Tyrolese music-master, residing at Balham, whom he put into the\\r\\nbox, and who was well known, as it chanced, to the foreman of the\\r\\njury. Gradually he made it clear to us that no portraits existed of\\r\\nColonel Clay at all, except Dolly Lingfield\\'s--so it dawned upon\\r\\nme by degrees that even Dr. Beddersley could only have been misled\\r\\nif we had succeeded in finding for him the alleged photographs of\\r\\nColonel Clay as the count and the curate, which had been shown us\\r\\nby Medhurst. Altogether, the prisoner based his defence upon the\\r\\nfact that no more than two witnesses directly identified him; while\\r\\none of those two had positively sworn that he recognised as the\\r\\nprisoner\\'s two portraits which turned out, by independent evidence,\\r\\nto be taken from other people!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe judge summed up in a caustic way which was pleasant to neither\\r\\nparty. He asked the jury to dismiss from their minds entirely the\\r\\nimpression created by what he frankly described as \"Sir Charles\\r\\nVandrift\\'s obvious dishonesty.\" They must not allow the fact that he\\r\\nwas a millionaire--and a particularly shady one--to prejudice their\\r\\nfeelings in favour of the prisoner. Even the richest--and vilest--of\\r\\nmen must be protected. Besides, this was a public question. If a\\r\\nrogue cheated a rogue, he must still be punished. If a murderer\\r\\nstabbed or shot a murderer, he must still be hung for it. Society\\r\\nmust see that the worst of thieves were not preyed upon by others.\\r\\nTherefore, the proved facts that Sir Charles Vandrift, with all his\\r\\nmillions, had meanly tried to cheat the prisoner, or some other poor\\r\\nperson, out of valuable diamonds--had basely tried to juggle Lord\\r\\nCraig-Ellachie\\'s mines into his own hands--had vilely tried to bribe\\r\\na son to betray his father--had directly tried, by underhand means,\\r\\nto save his own money, at the risk of destroying the wealth of\\r\\nothers who trusted to his probity--these proved facts must not\\r\\nblind them to the truth that the prisoner at the bar (if he were\\r\\nreally Colonel Clay) was an abandoned swindler. To that point alone\\r\\nthey must confine their attention; and _if_ they were convinced that\\r\\nthe prisoner was shown to be the self-same man who appeared on\\r\\nvarious occasions as David Granton, as Von Lebenstein, as Medhurst,\\r\\nas Schleiermacher, they must find him guilty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to that point, also, the judge commented on the obvious strength\\r\\nof the police case, and the fact that the prisoner had not attempted\\r\\nin any one out of so many instances to prove an alibi. Surely, if\\r\\nhe were _not_ Colonel Clay, the jury should ask themselves, must it\\r\\nnot have been simple and easy for him to do so? Finally, the judge\\r\\nsummed up all the elements of doubt in the identification--and all\\r\\nthe elements of probability; and left it to the jury to draw their\\r\\nown conclusions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey retired at the end to consider their verdict. While they were\\r\\nabsent every eye in court was fixed on the prisoner. But Paul\\r\\nFinglemore himself looked steadily towards the further end of the\\r\\nhall, where two pale-faced women sat together, with handkerchiefs\\r\\nin their hands, and eyes red with weeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly then, as he stood there, awaiting the verdict, with a fixed\\r\\nwhite face, prepared for everything, did I begin to realise with\\r\\nwhat courage and pluck that one lone man had sustained so long an\\r\\nunequal contest against wealth, authority, and all the Governments\\r\\nof Europe, aided but by his own skill and two feeble women! Only\\r\\nthen did I feel he had played his reckless game through all those\\r\\nyears with _this_ ever before him! I found it hard to picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jury filed slowly back. There was dead silence in court as the\\r\\nclerk put the question, \"Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty\\r\\nor not guilty?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We find him guilty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On all the counts?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On all the counts of the indictment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women at the back burst into tears, unanimously.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Justice Rhadamanth addressed the prisoner. \"Have you anything\\r\\nto urge,\" he asked in a very stern tone, \"in mitigation of whatever\\r\\nsentence the Court may see fit to pass upon you?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing,\" the prisoner answered, just faltering slightly. \"I have\\r\\nbrought it upon myself--but--I have protected the lives of those\\r\\nnearest and dearest to me. I have fought hard for my own hand. I\\r\\nadmit my crime, and will face my punishment. I only regret that,\\r\\nsince we were both of us rogues--myself and the prosecutor--the\\r\\nlesser rogue should have stood here in the dock, and the greater in\\r\\nthe witness-box. Our country takes care to decorate each according\\r\\nto his deserts--to him, the Grand Cross of St. Michael and St.\\r\\nGeorge; to me, the Broad Arrow!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe judge gazed at him severely. \"Paul Finglemore,\" he said, passing\\r\\nsentence in his sardonic way, \"you have chosen to dedicate to the\\r\\nservice of fraud abilities and attainments which, if turned from the\\r\\noutset into a legitimate channel, would no doubt have sufficed to\\r\\nsecure you without excessive effort a subsistence one degree above\\r\\nstarvation--possibly even, with good luck, a sordid and squalid\\r\\ncompetence. You have preferred to embark them on a lawless life of\\r\\nvice and crime--and I will not deny that you seem to have had a good\\r\\nrun for your money. Society, however, whose mouthpiece I am, cannot\\r\\nallow you any longer to mock it with impunity. You have broken its\\r\\nlaws openly, and you have been found out.\" He assumed the tone of\\r\\nbland condescension which always heralds his severest moments. \"I\\r\\nsentence you to Fourteen Years\\' Imprisonment, with Hard Labour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner bowed, without losing his apparent composure. But his\\r\\neyes strayed away again to the far end of the hall, where the two\\r\\nweeping women, with a sudden sharp cry, fell at once in a faint on\\r\\none another\\'s shoulders, and were with difficulty removed from court\\r\\nby the ushers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we left the room, I heard but one comment all round, thus voiced\\r\\nby a school-boy: \"I\\'d a jolly sight rather it had been old Vandrift.\\r\\nThis Clay chap\\'s too clever by half to waste on a prison!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he went there, none the less--in that \"cool sequestered vale\\r\\nof life\" to recover equilibrium; though I myself half regretted it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will add but one more little parting episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all was over, Charles rushed off to Cannes, to get away from\\r\\nthe impertinent stare of London. Amelia and Isabel and I went with\\r\\nhim. We were driving one afternoon on the hills beyond the town,\\r\\namong the myrtle and lentisk scrub, when we noticed in front of us\\r\\na nice victoria, containing two ladies in very deep mourning. We\\r\\nfollowed it, unintentionally, as far as Le Grand Pin--that big pine\\r\\ntree that looks across the bay towards Antibes. There, the ladies\\r\\ndescended and sat down on a knoll, gazing out disconsolately towards\\r\\nthe sea and the islands. It was evident they were suffering very\\r\\ndeep grief. Their faces were pale and their eyes bloodshot. \"Poor\\r\\nthings!\" Amelia said. Then her tone altered suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, good gracious,\" she cried, \"if it isn\\'t C\\xc3\\xa9sarine!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it was--with White Heather!\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles got down and drew near them. \"I beg your pardon,\" he said,\\r\\nraising his hat, and addressing Madame Picardet: \"I believe I have\\r\\nhad the pleasure of meeting you. And since I have doubtless paid in\\r\\nthe end for your victoria, _may_ I venture to inquire for whom you\\r\\nare in mourning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite Heather drew back, sobbing; but C\\xc3\\xa9sarine turned to him, fiery\\r\\nred, with the mien of a lady. \"For _him_!\" she answered; \"for Paul!\\r\\nfor our king, whom _you_ have imprisoned! As long as _he_ remains\\r\\nthere, we have both of us decided to wear mourning for ever!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles raised his hat again, and drew back without one word.\\r\\nHe waved his hand to Amelia and walked home with me to Cannes.\\r\\nHe seemed deeply dejected.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A penny for your thoughts!\" I exclaimed, at last, in a jocular\\r\\ntone, trying feebly to rouse him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to me, and sighed. \"I was wondering,\" he answered, \"if\\r\\n_I_ had gone to prison, would Amelia and Isabel have done as much\\r\\nfor me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor myself, I did _not_ wonder. I knew pretty well.

A\\r\\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\\r\\nand editing by those who wish to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web sites at:\\r\\nhttp://gutenberg.net or\\r\\nhttp://promo.net/pg\\r\\n\\r\\nThese Web sites include award-winning information about Project\\r\\nGutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new\\r\\netexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThose of you who want to download any Etext before announcement\\r\\ncan get to them as follows, and just download by date.

The\\r\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\r\\nto get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\r\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our\\r\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value\\r\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\r\\nmillion dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text\\r\\nfiles per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+\\r\\nWe are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002\\r\\nIf they reach just 1-2% of the world\\'s population then the total\\r\\nwill reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year\\'s end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!\\r\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\r\\nwhich is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):\\r\\n\\r\\neBooks Year Month\\r\\n\\r\\n    1  1971 July\\r\\n   10  1991 January\\r\\n  100  1994 January\\r\\n 1000  1997 August\\r\\n 1500  1998 October\\r\\n 2000  1999 December\\r\\n 2500  2000 December\\r\\n 3000  2001 November\\r\\n 4000  2001 October/November\\r\\n 6000  2002 December*\\r\\n 9000  2003 November*\\r\\n10000  2004 January*\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created\\r\\nto secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of February, 2002, contributions are being solicited from people\\r\\nand organizations in: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut,\\r\\nDelaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois,\\r\\nIndiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts,\\r\\nMichigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New\\r\\nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,\\r\\nOklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South\\r\\nDakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West\\r\\nVirginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have filed in all 50 states now, but these are the only ones\\r\\nthat have responded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the requirements for other states are met, additions to this list\\r\\nwill be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.\\r\\nPlease feel free to ask to check the status of your state.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn answer to various questions we have received on this:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally\\r\\nrequest donations in all 50 states.
